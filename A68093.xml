            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That which I Å¿peake, to be true, you your Å¿elues know, moÅ¿t learned fathers, and can very well teÅ¿tifye: who haue heard him publikely teachinge, who haue heard him diÅ¿putinge with great commendation, who haue heard him familiarly talkinge with his friendes.</p>
            <p>Many other witneÅ¿Å¿es there be thoroughout all Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manye, and other nations, men famouÅ¿ly learned, which either reÅ¿orted to his <hi>Scoles,</hi> or other wiÅ¿e were more familiarly acquainted with him. His bookes are witneÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es that he wrote and publiÅ¿hed, which are of great learned men eÅ¿teemed and read amonge the workes of the beÅ¿t learned writers: as <hi>thoÅ¿e Å¿hort Scolies vppon the EpiÅ¿tle to the Romaynes:</hi> as, the <hi>two bookes Of framing of Diuine Sermons:</hi> as, the <hi>fower bookes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diuine:</hi> as, the <hi>two bookes Of reading and daily meditation of the holy Scriptures:</hi> as, that <hi>CathechiÅ¿me</hi> or <hi>Shorte InÅ¿truction</hi> which he laÅ¿t put foorth.</p>
            <p>Many other bookes of his are witneÅ¿Å¿es alÅ¿o, penned and written by him with great laboures and watchinges, which we are Å¿ory could not of him be ouerÅ¿Ã©ene and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized: that Å¿o, which would haue turned to the great profit of all Å¿tudious <hi>Diuines,</hi> they might haue come abrode.

But euen out of thoÅ¿e notwithÅ¿tanding which he hath already put foorth, may all theÅ¿e thinges alÅ¿o be Å¿ufficiently percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, though I Å¿hould holde my peace. We haue maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forÅ¿ooth often times, whenÅ¿oeuer any thinge was propounded in familiar talke as touching <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall</hi> matters, to heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had alwaies in a readines out of auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t hiÅ¿tories Å¿ome thing that made for the mater in queÅ¿tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; how he did Å¿o promptly illuÅ¿trate &amp; determine the Å¿ame. But there was no leÅ¿Å¿e power in the man of teaching and arguing, then ther was furniture of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and erudition. With what force and facilitye be taught, the Å¿elfe Å¿ame can teÅ¿tify, that are witneÅ¿Å¿es before of his other gifts: what dexteritie in diÅ¿puting,
<pb facs="tcp:22885:10"/>what Å¿harpenes of witte he alwayes vÅ¿ed, his bearers doe remember. He would not (as many are wont to do) dally and Å¿coffe at the argumentes propoÅ¿ed: neyther handeled he the matter with clamoures and outcryes, whereby no profit could redound to the hearers: but hÃ©e Å¿o openly and grauely diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed all thinges, that the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearers might receyue thereby moÅ¿t ample fruite. And in this his maner as well of teaching as of reaÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he was alwaies from time to time of Å¿o great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿tye, and of Å¿o great conÅ¿tancye: that neyther woulde he vnaduiÅ¿edly moue idle queÅ¿tions, neyther alter or interrupt the order of teaching that he had once with iudgement taken in hande. As touching which thing, you remember I am Å¿ure, right learned MaÅ¿ter <hi>Chun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade Mathew,</hi> my very worÅ¿hipfull kinÅ¿eman, what he Å¿ayd the Å¿elfe Å¿ame daye he let his lyfe, either of vs both you and I being preÅ¿ent with him. <hi>I, Å¿ayeth he, haue alwayes bene carefull of this in the Schole, that I might propound profitable doctrine to my hearers, and auoyde idle and Å¿uperfluous queÅ¿tions: I haue taken diligent heede, leaÅ¿te I Å¿hould giue anye occaÅ¿ion of contentions, and haue euermore reteyned one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme order of teaching: and Å¿o long as I liue, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne.</hi> TheÅ¿e in a maner were his wordes: which when we had heard not without teares, we affirmed that we were witneÅ¿Å¿es of that matter: and how that we lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e had alwaies hitherto kept the fame order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and would kÃ©epe alÅ¿o hereafter. But as touching that which perteyneth to his fidelitie and diligence, in the office of teaching, there is no cauÅ¿e why I Å¿houlde Å¿aye much. I appeale to the felfe Å¿ame to teÅ¿tifie of his diligence that were witneÅ¿Å¿es euen now of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abilitye in teaching. This is certaine, he was rauiÅ¿hed with Å¿o great zeale and feruencie in promoting the Å¿tudies of holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that ouer and beÅ¿ides the laboures y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> were enioyned him, he would also ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hooÅ¿e to himÅ¿elfe vacant houres, wherin he might teach
<pb facs="tcp:22885:10"/>Å¿omething extraordinarily. He dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly procured and Å¿et forward the exerciÅ¿es of <hi>diÅ¿putations</hi> and <hi>declamations,</hi> wherein as he alone by the Å¿pace of certaine yeres was alwaies w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great trauayle the chiefe: Å¿o afterward when other of vs alÅ¿o his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>panions kept our courÅ¿e in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order, he was both willingly and commonly preÅ¿ent.</p>
            <p>As for the forme &amp; maner of preaching in the <hi>Schole,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what great laboure, I pray you, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what great payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes did he order it? He preÅ¿cribed common places, which he thought moÅ¿t nÃ©edeful to be handeled: he correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Sermons</hi> written by <hi>Studentes,</hi> before they were recited: he hearde alÅ¿o them that were appoynted to preach, before they Å¿hould openly come into the <hi>Church:</hi> to the intent that if any thinge were amiÅ¿Å¿e either in their voyce, or in their geÅ¿tures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alÅ¿o might be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded. He praiÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had wel behaued themÅ¿elues in theÅ¿e exerciÅ¿es: he reproued and pricked forwarde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> negligent and Å¿louthfull vnto diligence. He had adioyned to theÅ¿e kindes of exerciÅ¿es, beÅ¿ides an <hi>Examining</hi> in matters of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> which he appointed once commonly in two yeres, a certain order alÅ¿o of <hi>Diuine ConÅ¿ultation:</hi> where Å¿ome queÅ¿tion bÃ©eing propofided either of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or of <hi>rites</hi> and matters <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall,</hi> he would bid euery one in order to put foorth his opinion in a full &amp; continewed forme of Å¿peaking: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent that Å¿o by diuers &amp; Å¿undrye Å¿entences on either Å¿ide giuen, it might be perceyued out of many what was true, &amp; what falÅ¿e, what made for the pourpoÅ¿e, and what might be Å¿ayd againÅ¿t it. All which labours be Å¿o willingly tooke vpon him, that hauing alÅ¿o no rewarde appointed for his paynes, he neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e moÅ¿t diligently proÅ¿ecuted the Å¿ame. I omit his priuate Å¿tudies, of which I will now Å¿ay nothing more, then that which I may truely auouch: namely, that he was neuer at home alone, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he either wrote Å¿omething, or read Å¿omething, or meditated Å¿omething: Å¿o far foorth that bÃ©e Å¿Ã©emed vnto me euen to weaken and debilitate the

There was in him beÅ¿ides all theÅ¿e thinges, a moÅ¿t diligent meditation touching the reforming of Churches, wherein he was occupied day and night. For he coueted greatly to reuoke the people of our Nation to the paterne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityue Church: he coueted to remoue many tryfles, which bÃ©eing deriued from the <hi>Papa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning which thinges much more might of one be Å¿ayde, and that with great commendation, but that I haÅ¿ten to the other partes of my <hi>Oration.</hi> In prayÅ¿ing therfore the lyfe and maners of this moÅ¿t fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and excellent man, there is no cauÅ¿e why I Å¿hould much Å¿tand, eÅ¿pecially before you and in your preÅ¿ence. He was Å¿ufficiently knowen vnto you all, euen Å¿traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers alÅ¿o knew Å¿ufficiently the Å¿tate of his lyfe. In dyet and apparell he was alwayes moÅ¿t temperate, in feaÅ¿ting moÅ¿t Å¿ober, in talke and dealing moÅ¿t friendly and iuÅ¿t. As he deteÅ¿ted from his hart thoÅ¿e vnÅ¿ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quaffinges and vncomely Å¿pÃ©eches commonly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of our Countrymen at the time of their bancque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges: Å¿o againe would he now &amp; then be willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent at the moderate feaÅ¿tes and pleaÅ¿aunt mÃ©etinges of his friendes. Thus, he neither allowed of the things that were vnÅ¿Ã©emely: nor diÅ¿allowed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things that might be graunted to the honeÅ¿t recreation of the mynde. To be Å¿hort, he Å¿o behaued himÅ¿elfe in
<pb facs="tcp:22885:11"/>all places and towarde all men, that his maner Å¿Ã©emed not onely pleaÅ¿aunt to the learned, but alÅ¿o moÅ¿t Å¿wÃ©ete and delectable to the rude and ignoraunt. By reaÅ¿on whereof, how dÃ©ere he was not onely to our <hi>Scole,</hi> but alÅ¿o to the whole citie, the manyfold teares of all Å¿ortes of people which your eyes haue Å¿Ã©ene Å¿hed at the Å¿olem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his buriall, doe Å¿ufficiently declare. But when as by the Å¿pace of 22. yeres, and odde monethes, he had in Å¿uch order as wÃ©e haue Å¿aid, behaued him Å¿elfe: as he was a man of no great health, Å¿o when he had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certain wÃ©ekes before with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinual rhewmes and coughes, the xxiii. day of <hi>Ianuarye</hi> he began to wax Å¿ore Å¿icke and to kÃ©epe his bedde. He complayned moÅ¿t chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the paynes of his head, breaÅ¿t and Å¿ides: and nowe and then all his members Å¿o burned, that they Å¿Ã©emed to be Å¿haken with a certaine quiuering or trembling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. And verily all that wÃ©eke, when as yet we did not diÅ¿payre of his lyfe, he talked &amp; conferred many things both with others, &amp; alÅ¿o eÅ¿pecially with mÃ©e who was of euer preÅ¿ent with him, as touching matters pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Scole,</hi> as touching Diuine Å¿tudies, as touching the reformation of Churches. He Å¿ayd amongeÅ¿t other thinges, that there Å¿hould order be taken, if he liued, for the pertition of certaine labours betwixt vs, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoÅ¿e of ordering of Sermons: which for bicauÅ¿e he had hitherto Å¿uÅ¿teined alone, he thought that he had loÅ¿t his health.

AmongeÅ¿t the reÅ¿t, when a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boye of his, of thrÃ©e yeres old, Å¿toode by his beddes Å¿ide: Learne, Å¿aith he, <hi>my childe, the commaundementes of the Lorde, and hee Å¿hall take care of thee.</hi> After much talke had, he entreated diligently with thoÅ¿e that for duties Å¿ake came to viÅ¿it him, as touching the profeÅ¿Å¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of his fayth, and the conÅ¿tancy of that doctrine which he had taught. And truely the very firÅ¿t day of <hi>Februarie,</hi> wherein alÅ¿o he departed, all his talke was altogether in this, that he might teÅ¿tifie vnto thoÅ¿e whome he Å¿awe preÅ¿ent: that he remayned euento the laÅ¿t gaÅ¿pe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant and inflexible in that profeÅ¿Å¿ion of fayth &amp; doctrine, which he Å¿o many yeres had profeÅ¿Å¿ed in the <hi>Scole.</hi> As touching which point I might now make a further diÅ¿courÅ¿e, moÅ¿t excellent fathers, but that the teares for remembraunce of theÅ¿e things breake foorth from mine eyes.

The former cauÅ¿e taketh no place in our heauines: the later miniÅ¿treth vnto vs Å¿adnes moÅ¿t Å¿orrowfull.

For Å¿ome were holden of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Å¿ome were gouerned by Women: other Å¿ome ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by yonge men, which were newly come to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them the charge of the <hi>Common wealth.</hi> HÃ©e af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmed that there were in dÃ©ede Å¿ome Princes remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in gouernment, but very fewe, both graue in yeres, and alÅ¿o expert in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vÅ¿e of thinges, which did as it were Å¿till euery way suÅ¿teine with their Å¿houlders the whole weight and burthen of the <hi>Empyre.</hi> HÃ©e remembered the <hi>Scoles</hi> Å¿cattered and torne in Å¿under throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> either by ciuill warres, or by the wofull perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Godly, or by the death &amp; decay of famous and worthy Teachers. He Å¿hewed the Å¿tate of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, how miÅ¿erably they were afflicted, as well for that they were bÃ©ereft of their notable PaÅ¿tors &amp; Doctors, whoÅ¿e like were not to be founde to Å¿uccÃ©ede them: as alÅ¿o bicauÅ¿e they were vexed with Å¿traunge and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diÅ¿cordes: and further that Å¿uch were the times now and maners of men, that it Å¿Ã©emed that almighty God very Å¿hortly, being prouoked with our manifold enormities, would take away his kingdome from vs, &amp; giue it vnto others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿hould bring foorth more worthy fruites.

Therefore I will moÅ¿te willingly,

HÃ©e hath eÅ¿caped the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and calamities of this wretched lyfe: he enioyeth nowe perpetuall and neuer chaunging delightes with ChriÅ¿t. HÃ©e hath put off that body of his, Å¿ubiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: He loketh now to put on a body immortall &amp; incorruptible. He hath forÅ¿aken theÅ¿e <hi>Scoles</hi> of ours: he is admitted into the <hi>Scole</hi> of heauen. Whom here he Å¿awe as it were in a glaÅ¿Å¿e by a darke Å¿peaking: him now he beholdeth face to face. The crowne of glory that neuer Å¿hall decaye, which he alwayes in the whole courÅ¿e of his Å¿tudies and laboures trauayled vnto: is now giuen vnto him of the Lorde, wherein he tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth and reioyceth.

               <p>And oft times it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that certaine Å¿innes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (for aÅ¿much as they are commnoly and euery where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controlmente committed) be by the iudgement of the common people Å¿uppoÅ¿ed not to be Å¿o haynous as they are in dÃ©ede: of whiche Å¿orte are, concupiÅ¿cence, hatred of our neighbour, reuilements, periurie, brawlings, dronkennes, offences giuen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of theÅ¿e therfore when the Preacher Å¿hall fortune to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, he Å¿hall not without good cauÅ¿e, by vÅ¿inge of amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, goe about to declare the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿ame. In reÅ¿pect wherof. <hi>EÅ¿ay Cap. 1.</hi>

               <p>Sometimes it Å¿o falleth out that certaine notable vertues are neglected, or be not eÅ¿tÃ©emed as they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: wherefore throughe <hi>amplifications</hi> they Å¿hall bee aduaunced to the dignitye whiche of right they ought to haue.</p>

               <p>Oft times the Å¿entence which occurreth in holy Å¿cripture, comprehendeth a notable exhortation vnto vertue, or els Å¿heweth how the lyfe &amp; maners of a ChriÅ¿tian man ought to be without all Å¿inne and offence.</p>
               <p>The Å¿entences, therfore, that are of themÅ¿elues Å¿uch, it is mÃ©ete they be accepted for holÅ¿om admonitions.</p>

               <p>That thing is witneÅ¿Å¿ed in the epiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Romanes. Cap. 12.13.</hi> &amp;c. LikewiÅ¿e in the epiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Galat.</hi> in part of the <hi>cap. 5.</hi> and <hi>cap. 6.</hi> the whole, to the <hi>EpheÅ¿ians. cap 4.5.6.</hi>

               <p>The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Romans. 6.</hi> teacheth vs this Å¿entence, Å¿aying:

               </p>
               <p>The partes of holy Scripture are accuÅ¿tomed to bee Å¿et forth in two Å¿ortes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1</hi> The one conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in a continuall hiÅ¿toricall narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which notwithÅ¿tandinge Å¿omwhere appeareth that which doth not obÅ¿curely argue, to what kynde of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the Å¿ame ought to bÃ©e aÅ¿cribed.</p>
               <p>For in dÃ©ede the moÅ¿t parte of the narrations in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliÅ¿tes doe perteyne to the kynde <hi>didaÅ¿calick,</hi> forÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they doe chiefely eÅ¿tabliÅ¿he this doctrine, to wit, that, IeÅ¿us is ChriÅ¿t, that is to Å¿ay, the true MeÅ¿Å¿ins and true God, by whom; whoÅ¿oeuer belÃ©eue us him, doe aÅ¿pire to eternall Å¿aluation Which doctrine or generall Å¿entence, to be the common Å¿cope of the Euangelicall narrations, <hi>Iohn Cap. 20.</hi> hath expreÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2</hi> The other Å¿orte is, when all that parte is Å¿imp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿pente and conÅ¿umed in teachinge, namely Å¿o, as with argumentes diÅ¿tinct, and one followinge an other, and directed to one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame ende, a certayne Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or aÅ¿Å¿ertion is there handeled and Å¿et forth.</p>
               <p>Example may bÃ©e taken out of the fourth Chapiter of the EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Romaynes.</hi> No man Å¿Ã©eth not in all that Chapiter diuers proofes and reaÅ¿ones to bÃ©e packed togither, whereof euery one proueth a man to bÃ©e iuÅ¿tified by fayth without workes.</p>

               <p>Of either parte of the Å¿acred Scriptures, it Å¿hall bÃ©e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiÅ¿ite at this preÅ¿ent that wÃ©e note Å¿o much as we Å¿hall

               </p>
               <p>Of which Å¿ort Å¿oeuer it Å¿hall fortune the holy reading to bÃ©e offred, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that hee which is deÅ¿poÅ¿ed to gather and excerpte common places, before all thinges doo peruÅ¿e ouer the wholle once and peraduenture twyÅ¿e or thriÅ¿e, till Å¿uch tyme, as he may well conceyue the Å¿imple meaninge of the wordes.</p>
               <p>Then let him returne backe to the canueÅ¿Å¿inge of all the partes and members, and Å¿tayinge a littell at euery of them, let him conÅ¿ider, and weigh more dÃ©epely with him Å¿elfe, whither any thing may bÃ©e drawen out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of the Å¿ame member perteyninge, either vnto doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to Å¿aye, the confirmation of true aÅ¿Å¿ertions, or to the <hi>redargution</hi> of falÅ¿e opinions, or to the inÅ¿titution of lyfe in rightuouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, or to the correction of vniuÅ¿te dealinge, or laÅ¿tely vnto conÅ¿olation.</p>

               <p>For they are beyond meaÅ¿ure plentifull, and doe eftÅ¿ones bringe forth profitable common places, of all thinges, which are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the perfection of a ChriÅ¿tian man. Neither occurreth any readinge of Scripture Å¿o barren and vnfruitefull, but that the wordes placed in the text, do miniÅ¿ter Å¿om thing anÅ¿werable to thoÅ¿e general places. But go to, let vs make a triall, and take in hande Å¿ome examples of the former Å¿orte, which namely conÅ¿iÅ¿t in hiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall narrations, and let vs examyn them according to the Å¿ayde fyue generall places of inuention.

               <p>
                  <hi>For thus it is written by the prophet: And thou Bethlem in the lande of Iuda, art not the leaÅ¿te amonge the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iuda. For out of thee Å¿hall there come a capitayne, that Å¿hall gouerne my people IÅ¿raell.</hi>

When they had harde the Kinge, they departed, and loe, the Å¿tarre which they Å¿awe in the EaÅ¿t, went before them, till it came and Å¿tode ouer the place wherein the young childe was. When they Å¿awe the Å¿tar, they reioyÅ¿ed exceedingly with great ioye. And went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houÅ¿e, and founde the younge childe with Mary his mother, and fell downe, and worÅ¿hipped him, and opened their treaÅ¿ures, and preÅ¿ented vnto him giftes, golde, and FrankenÅ¿ence, and Mirre.

               <p>But this Å¿igne I haue founde to be in ChriÅ¿t. ChriÅ¿t is he therfore that can giue the holy ghoÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Wherfore if we duly weigh the matter, the diuinitie of ChriÅ¿t is here proued and commended by two Å¿ignes.

But the fiÅ¿hermen were gone out of them, and were waÅ¿shinge their nettes. And he entred into one of the Å¿hippes, which perteyned to Simon, and prayed him that he would thruÅ¿te out a litle from the lande: and hee Å¿at downe, and taught the people out of the Å¿hippe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> hee had left Å¿peakinge, hee Å¿aide vnto Simon: Launche out into the diepe, and let Å¿lippe your nettes to make a draught.

When Symon Peter Å¿awe this, hee feel downe at IeÅ¿us knees, Å¿ayinge: Lorde goe from mee, for I am a Å¿infull man.

               <p>
                  <hi>Two of the diÅ¿ciples of IeÅ¿us went that Å¿ame daye to a towne which was from HieruÅ¿alem about threeÅ¿core fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes, called Emaus.

And he Å¿ayd vnto them: what thinges? And they Å¿aide vnto him: of IeÅ¿us of Nazareth, which was a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet, mightie in deede &amp; in word before God, and all the people. And how the high prieÅ¿tes, and our rulers deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be condemned to death, &amp; haue crucified him.

Yea and certaine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among vs made vs aÅ¿tonied, which came earely to the Å¿epulchre, and when they found not his body, they came Å¿aying, that they had alÅ¿o Å¿eene a viÅ¿ion of angels, whiche Å¿aide that he was aliue. Therfore certaine of them which were with vs, went to the Å¿epulchre, and founde it euen Å¿o as the women had Å¿aid, but him they Å¿awe not. Then he Å¿aide vnto them: O fooles and Å¿low of harte to beleeue al that the Prophets haue Å¿poken. Oughte not ChriÅ¿te to haue Å¿uffered theÅ¿e thinges, and to enter into his glorye? And he began at MoyÅ¿es, and at all the prophetes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretd vnto them in all the Å¿criptures, the thinges which were writen of him. And they drewe neere to the towne, which they went vnto, but he made as though hee woulde haue gone further. But they conÅ¿trained him, Å¿aying: Abide with vs, for it draweth towards night, and the day is farre Å¿pent. And Å¿o he went in to tary with them. And it came to paÅ¿Å¿e, as he Å¿ate at the table with them, he tooke breade and gaue thankes, and brake it, and gaue it vnto them.</hi>

In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿econd place is added y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which declareth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> al thoÅ¿e y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are touched with any deÅ¿yre at al of profiting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of true religion are cared for of god, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god will in no wiÅ¿e forÅ¿ake them. I <hi>haue compaÅ¿sion</hi> (Å¿ayth he) <hi>on the multitude.</hi> Thirdly, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of the diÅ¿ciples Å¿uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿inge that it coulde not be that Å¿o many might be Å¿atiÅ¿fied with breade in the wildernes, may bÃ©e gathered: that thoÅ¿e which prepare themÅ¿elues to the Å¿tudy of Å¿acred and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thynges, are firÅ¿t hindered and oppreÅ¿Å¿ed with many griefes and temptations, before they can attayne to their wiÅ¿hed Å¿cope, yea and ofte times they Å¿trike vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rockes (as they Å¿aye) euen in the very heauen it Å¿elfe, and are haled awaye from their godly purpoÅ¿e. But whereas chriÅ¿t in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth place demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth of his diÅ¿ciples how ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny leaues they haue, we are taught euidently thereby, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God hath alwayes in a readines diuers apte and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient meanes, whereby he may prouibe for the godly, &amp; next after Å¿pirituall or heauenly benefytes miniÅ¿ter alÅ¿o corporall or earthly.</p>
               <p>For by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we leaÅ¿t thinke off, god Å¿uccureth all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22885:132"/>thoÅ¿e that labour and be in neceÅ¿Å¿itie. And therefore in the fyfte place ChriÅ¿t giueth vnto his diÅ¿ciples, that they Å¿houlde Å¿et before others. for God Å¿endeth alwayes in Å¿eaÅ¿on teachers, which maye with all fydelitie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence enÅ¿tructe thoÅ¿e that are deÅ¿irous to learne. LaÅ¿tely and in the Å¿ixt place; they all eate and are Å¿uffyÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>They that a litle before hongered and thriÅ¿ted after the knowledge of the trueth, doe now happely profyt therein, yea and Å¿o far forth doe they efteÅ¿oones procÃ©ede, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there remayneth vnto them, what they may giue an imparte vnto others, and at the length may, either publikely or priuately teach the doctrine of pietie vnto the reÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Nowe that hiÅ¿tory likewiÅ¿e of <hi>Mathew 2.</hi> as touching the wiÅ¿e men that come from the EaÅ¿t to worÅ¿hip ChriÅ¿t, it Å¿hall be very eaÅ¿ye to applye wholy to the tractation of one common place. The Å¿tate or common place maye apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee prefixed, as concerninge vocation or callynge.</p>
               <p>This Å¿tate beinge aÅ¿Å¿igned, firÅ¿t of all Å¿hall bee declared, whenÅ¿oeuer God calleth any man by a Å¿igne either exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or internall, or rather by them both, to the knowledge and confeÅ¿Å¿ion of the GoÅ¿pell, or els to Å¿ome certaine kinde of lyfe, in which he may dayly Å¿erue God and profyte his neighbour, that he ought not to refuÅ¿e, but with chÃ©erefull harte to come and deuoutly obaye vnto the caller.</p>
               <p>In the Å¿econde place where it is reported that <hi>Herode</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole citie was troubled, thou Å¿halt not without cauÅ¿e inculke an exhortation to ouercome temptations.</p>
               <p>For thus commonly it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, aÅ¿Å¿oone as any is elected and called of God to a godly worke Sathan by and by together with his conÅ¿pirators the fleÅ¿he and the worlde worketh wiles, and leaueth nothinge vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whereby they may withdrawe him from his good and holy purpoÅ¿e. But their followeth in the thirde place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which in this kinde of conflict bringeth an excÃ©eding great comforte, namely that againÅ¿t the moÅ¿t fierce and bitter temptations a preÅ¿ent remedie is to be Å¿ought for out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scripture.
<pb facs="tcp:22885:133"/>The lawe, the prophetes, and ApoÅ¿tles doo certifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience as touchinge thinges doubtefull, they Å¿hewe moÅ¿t apparauntly where ChriÅ¿t is to be founde, and where the minde finally may reÅ¿t in Å¿afetye.</p>
               <p>For it is euen the holy Scripture alone, that confirmeth and Å¿uÅ¿teyneth thÃ©e in the knowledge and confeÅ¿Å¿ion of the GoÅ¿pell, in Å¿incere faith, in puritie of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation. Fourthly, where the Å¿ubtelty of <hi>Herode</hi> priuily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the wiÅ¿e men vnto him is diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed, Å¿hall very well be added that after the firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t grieuous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ouercome, and after the minde is confirmed, and that by the ayde of Gods worde, in hir calling &amp; holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, there remayne as yet Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿iuely newe daungers which hipocrits, which falÅ¿e teachers or heretickes, which tyrauntes, and Å¿uch kinde of aduerÅ¿aries of true religion will forge and contriue.</p>
               <p>For as longe as we liue here in this life, ther is nothing but perils vppon perils, and euen as if a certaine rancke of troubles were linked togither with chains, Å¿o doth one diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e after an other faÅ¿ten vppon the godly.</p>
               <p>But yet we ought in no cace to be diÅ¿couraged in our minds through the frequency or greatneÅ¿Å¿e of the perills.</p>
               <p>Hitherto perteineth that which followeth in the fift place, as touching the departure of the wiÅ¿e men, and the Å¿tarre againe going before them.</p>
               <p>Thou Å¿halt here not vnexpertly add, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which by vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Å¿triuinge bath already eÅ¿caped the daungers of the firÅ¿t and Å¿econde Å¿orte, doth nowe lye (as it were) at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and reÅ¿t in a quiet baye. For let the Champion of ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿tantly enÅ¿ue the firÅ¿t Å¿ignes of his callinge, but moÅ¿t diligently let him folowe the Å¿cripture, which doth aÅ¿Å¿ure him of his vocation and all the order of his dutie, &amp; he Å¿hall (vndoubtedly) come vnto that place, where hee Å¿hall Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t in his glory, and obteyne thorough him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaÅ¿ting life.<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>He that endureth to the ende Å¿halbe Å¿aued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou Å¿eeÅ¿te therefore all the partes hereof not vnaptly to be reduced to one common place, as touching calling or

               <p>Againe in lyke maner the hiÅ¿torye out of <hi>Luke. 2.</hi> as concerning the confeÅ¿Å¿ion, which as well <hi>Simeon,</hi> as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> made of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿hall fruitfully be expounded, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of it, how neceÅ¿Å¿arye it is, that all the faithfull, whenÅ¿oeuer oportunitie will Å¿erue, Å¿houlde render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or that which is all one, make confeÅ¿Å¿ion of theyr faith.</p>
               <p>And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> this is the Å¿tate of the Å¿ayd reading, it Å¿hal truly vs auouched, as Å¿oone as mencion Å¿hal be made of <hi>Simeon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly at the wordes of <hi>Siemon,</hi> in which he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ChriÅ¿t to be put for the ruine and vpryÅ¿inge agayne of many, and for a Å¿igne which is Å¿poken agaynÅ¿t, &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that a Å¿worde Å¿houl perce <hi>Maries</hi> Å¿oule, Å¿hal aptely be intreated as touchinge that poynte, that a confeÅ¿Å¿ion made is alwayes purÅ¿ued with offences, Å¿ondry mocions, contencions and great daungers.</p>
               <p>The world neuer ceaÅ¿eth to bringe the godly confeÅ¿Å¿ors into peryll and hazard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where it is deÅ¿cribed what maner of perÅ¿on the Å¿ayde <hi>Anna</hi> was, how godly and vnblameably Å¿he lyued, very oportunely next after thoÅ¿e wordes briefelye decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Å¿hall be added, that whereÅ¿oeuer the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of faith taketh place, ther ought alÅ¿o manifeÅ¿t fruits of faith, and manifold exerciÅ¿es of pietie to be Å¿eene. Finally that confeÅ¿Å¿ion is known to be perfect, which on the one Å¿yde is accompanied with the perils of temptations &amp; perfecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and on the other Å¿ide with the notable fruites of faith.</p>
               <p>With Å¿uche a confeÅ¿Å¿ion God is delighted, the reÅ¿t of the godly are Å¿trengthened, the enemies are directed and diÅ¿couraged, the Diuell hymÅ¿elfe is diÅ¿comfited and Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dude.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Anna</hi> is reported to haue confeÅ¿Å¿ed lyke wiÅ¿e, and agreeing in al poynts with <hi>Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,</hi> to haue Å¿poken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And thus the whole Å¿ermon very neere Å¿hall be Å¿pent about one common plate touching the making of a confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of faith. But I feare leaÅ¿t ther be Å¿ome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil cry out and accuÅ¿e me to be ouer tedious: wherfore I forbeare to adde any more examples.</p>

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:22885:134"/>
               <p>The one part is of ChriÅ¿t the king mÃ©eke &amp; poore, whiche was contented to be caried vpon a Å¿he AÅ¿Å¿e: wherin <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oÅ¿tom</hi> teacheth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoÅ¿e things are only of vs to be Å¿ought for, which the neceÅ¿Å¿ary vÅ¿e of lyfe doth require, and that pouerty is to be taken in good part of al men.</p>

Therefore to the commending and Å¿etting forth of the poore tendeth the explications of the cauÅ¿e of the two partes, and Å¿tandinge Å¿omwhat long vpon either of them with great Å¿harpenes of Å¿peache, Å¿etting abroche all the engings of arguments, he exhorteth, vrgeth, Å¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth, impelleth all men to indeuour to be benefyciall to the poore.</p>
               <p>Nowe that hÃ©ere are to be Å¿Ã©ene allegorycall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, no man being in his right minde, will affirme, but all men may eaÅ¿ely perceiue them to bee playne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructions.

               <p>By the diÅ¿ciples putting their clothes vpon the beaÅ¿ts, that ChriÅ¿t might the more conueniently Å¿yt, to he mente the teachers of the GoÅ¿pell, which ought not vnwillingly to beÅ¿tow all that euer they haue, yea euen their bodye and Å¿oule, Å¿o that their hearers may be furthered, and the glory of ChriÅ¿t more and more Å¿et forth. And thus muche welnigh hath <hi>ChriÅ¿oÅ¿tom</hi> in that place.</p>
               <p>But yet there is no man that Å¿Ã©th not the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be very diÅ¿crepant, where one Å¿ayeth, that foraÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as ChriÅ¿te was contented to be caryed on an AÅ¿Å¿e and hir Colte, we are taught, that wee ought to liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a fewe thinges, and pacientlye to beare our neceÅ¿Å¿etie and agayne for that ChriÅ¿te was caried vppon an AÅ¿Å¿e and hir Colte, to bee Å¿ignified twoe peoples, to wit, the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that Å¿houlde acknowledge ChriÅ¿t to be their Lord, and receyue his goÅ¿pell.</p>
               <p>Agayne there is founde no Å¿mal difference, in caÅ¿e where the diÅ¿ciples are reported to haue layed their garmentes vpon the beaÅ¿tes, whereon ChriÅ¿t ought to Å¿itte, it be one while added, that all men are there admoniÅ¿hed willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue clothes and other neceÅ¿Å¿arys to the poore, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while it be Å¿ayde to Å¿ignifye, howe it behoueth the Preachers of the GoÅ¿pell to beÅ¿towe all that they haue, yea euen their body and Å¿oule for their flock.</p>
               <p>Certes thoÅ¿e former interpretations are excerpted out of the natiue Å¿enÅ¿e of the words Å¿tanding in the text, and be perÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly referred to the inÅ¿titution of lyfe, whiche thing is the cauÅ¿e, why <hi>ChriÅ¿oÅ¿tom</hi> diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿eth them with a more plentifull diÅ¿courÅ¿e: but in the later interpretaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons digreÅ¿Å¿ion is made from the proper Å¿ignifycation of the wordes, wherefore that they are allegorycall, and for &amp; that cauÅ¿e the leÅ¿Å¿e profitable to the information of

               <p>TheÅ¿e thinges therfore being duly conÅ¿idered, it wyll be very eaÅ¿y, to giue a right iudgement as touchinge the interpretations which wee haue vÅ¿ed in this preÅ¿ent Chapter.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t is briefely &amp; playnly expounded, in paÅ¿Å¿ing through all the partes, whatÅ¿oeuer belongeth to the Å¿acred narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Then to euery parte is ioyned an interpretation, in which appÃ©ereth nothing hard, wreÅ¿ted, or farre fet: but out of the aduiÅ¿ed conÅ¿ideration of the words and Å¿ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces are thoÅ¿e thinges deduced, which ingender holeÅ¿ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titutions or inÅ¿tructions of lyfe.</p>
               <p>And to make the matter more clÃ©ere and lightÅ¿om, euery thing is in Å¿uch Å¿ort diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, that all thinges are directed to the nature and true vÅ¿e of one common place. In which reÅ¿pect no doubt the hearers capacitie is better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, then if many thinges and the Å¿ame diuers and not euident Å¿hould be obtruded.</p>
               <p>Who therefore will deny this maner of interpretinge with great fruit to be exerciÅ¿ed, and to be both godly and profytably produced to the people in the Church?</p>
               <p>And, as I admoniÅ¿hed in the beginninge, to thoÅ¿e that in the partes of the hiÅ¿torycall narration can not by obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a certayne courÅ¿e and order of cauÅ¿es, effectes, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents,</hi> and Å¿uche lyke places, it is no harde matter to make and adorne theÅ¿e kindes of interpretations.</p>
               <p>But from allegories, Å¿uch ineÅ¿pecially as very neceÅ¿Å¿itie it Å¿elfe doth not extort in thoÅ¿e places of Scripture which of themÅ¿elues Å¿ygnifye otherwiÅ¿e Å¿ome inconuenience, euery man Å¿hall by mine aduice (Å¿o far forth as may be) abÅ¿teine.</p>

IuÅ¿tification therefore commeth by grace, and not by workes. And this is it that the apoÅ¿tle Å¿o Å¿tudiouÅ¿ly Å¿aith: <hi>That God imputeth vnto man rightuouÅ¿nes without wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</hi> Wherefore out of euery worde we Å¿Ã©e notable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons to be drawen.

               <p>Nowe he findeth that thinge to be done about fourtene yeres before <hi>CircumciÅ¿ion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">IIII.</note> Of this circumÅ¿tance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of time, he gathereth in the fourth place well nÃ©ere after this maner: <hi>If Abraham had bene iuÅ¿tified by workes, then chiefely by circumciÅ¿ion.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22885:140"/>But by this he was not iuÅ¿tified,</hi> foraÅ¿much <hi>as rightuouÅ¿nes was imputed vnto him longe time before he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed. Therfore in no wiÅ¿e commeth rightuouÅ¿nes by workes.</hi> The wordes of the ApoÅ¿tle as they Å¿tande in the text are playne. Furthermore ThapoÅ¿tle interlaceth foorth with the fifte argument,<note place="margin">V.</note> taken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vÅ¿e and Å¿ignification of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciÅ¿ion. Abraham receyued the Å¿igne of circumciÅ¿ion as a Å¿eale of the rightuouÅ¿nes of the Å¿aith which he had, when he was vnÅ¿ircumciÅ¿ed.</hi> Which we maye take euen as if he had Å¿ayde: <hi>CircumciÅ¿ion</hi> is not therefore receyued, to the intent any man Å¿houlde be iuÅ¿tified thereby, but that it might be a Å¿eale of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aÅ¿Å¿uraunce of rightuouÅ¿nes nowe before receyued by fayth. For a man muÅ¿t alwayes firÅ¿t beleeue and confeÅ¿Å¿e his faith, or euer he can rightly vÅ¿e any Å¿acrament inÅ¿tituted of god: and vnleÅ¿Å¿e a man alredye indued with faith doe receyue the Å¿acramentes, there is no cauÅ¿e whye he Å¿hould hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they will become holeÅ¿ome vnto him.</p>
               <p>There is no man that knoweth not the Å¿acramentes to be Å¿igns of the couenaunt made before with God, and that they are added as Å¿eales of our reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> with God, like as after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bargainers are agreed betwixt them Å¿elues wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Å¿eales are accuÅ¿tomed to be made.</p>
               <p>The Å¿ixt argument followeth of that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we Å¿hewed to be digeÅ¿ted in the fourth place.<note place="margin">VI.</note> Seeing nowe it appereth that faith was imputed vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> for rightuouÅ¿nes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was circumciÅ¿ed, &amp; whileÅ¿t he was yet vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ciÅ¿ed it is a plaine cace, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alÅ¿o which are not as yet circumciÅ¿ed, neyther dare chalendge to themÅ¿elues any good worke, may be iuÅ¿tified by fayth: and generally that vnto all men, whether they be circumciÅ¿ed or vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ed, rightuouÅ¿nes Å¿halbe imputed, Å¿o that by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham</hi> (which is indifferently the common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and prince of all belÃ©euers as well of the circumciÅ¿ed, as hauing vncircumciÅ¿ion) they repoÅ¿e their faith and confidence in God.

To the enÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and drawing forth of the nature of euery thing out of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, as many (certes) as are wiÅ¿ely occupyed in the office of preaching, Å¿o oft as they wyll entreat of Å¿im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple theames, doe Å¿et before them, as a rule, this order of queÅ¿tions. But yet this difference is to be marked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a <hi>Logician</hi> or philoÅ¿opher, and a diuine preacher. The <hi>Logician</hi> truely by his owne proper right, as he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vndertaketh and promiÅ¿eth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will vtter &amp; bring forth whatÅ¿oeuer may probably be Å¿ayde of euery argument y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is offered, &amp; imagineth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he hath diÅ¿ciples deÅ¿yrous to bee come philoÅ¿ophers, very curiouÅ¿lye and Å¿ubtelty purÅ¿ueth the courÅ¿e of all the Å¿aide queÅ¿tions.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Diuine,</hi> and Å¿pecially the Preacher, whiche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿eth himÅ¿elfe to be the teacher of the whole multitude, and in it of a greate number of vnlearned, Å¿uffereth not his oration to be encloÅ¿ed in Å¿o narrow Å¿traightes, but as one raunging in a champion fielde, choÅ¿eth thoÅ¿e queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onely to be explaned, whiche he Å¿uppoÅ¿eth to be moÅ¿te congruent to the vnderÅ¿tanding of his hearers, and alÅ¿o moÅ¿t fyt for the place and time.</p>
               <p>Wherfore albeit be premeditating at home in his Å¿tudye what thinges are expedyent to bee propounded in the Church, haue thoÅ¿e queÅ¿tions before his eyes as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators of his thoughtes, yet after that hee hath Å¿ome while debated the matter, he Å¿ticketh faÅ¿te in the inueÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation onelye of one or two or els of thrÃ©e queÅ¿tions at the moÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Herevpon therfore grew the cuÅ¿tome, whereby for the moÅ¿t part the paÅ¿tors of churches do in the firÅ¿t place lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly diÅ¿couer, what the thing is of whiche they purpoÅ¿e to entreate.</p>
               <p>Where if they be perÅ¿waded that the thing is knowen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:22885:144"/>to the hearers, then with good cauÅ¿e pretermit they that queÅ¿tion. From thence they procÃ©ede to an other queÅ¿tion, whiche they dÃ©eme to be moÅ¿t conueniente for the place time and perÅ¿ones, and doe alledge Å¿omewhat peraduenture of the thirde queÅ¿tion, whiche is as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauÅ¿es.</p>
               <p>This being accompliÅ¿hed, they paÅ¿Å¿e to that whiche is the fourth in number, namely, concerninge the duties or effectes.</p>
               <p>And in this wiÅ¿e with the explication of two or haply of thrÃ©e queÅ¿tions they make account to Å¿atiÅ¿fy their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Somtimes, and that not Å¿eldome, there happen thinges, which in no cace doe admit all the Å¿aid queÅ¿tions in Diuinitie. As for example, there is offered a thing that can be deuided into no parts or formes: Why then Å¿hould there be a queÅ¿tion prefixed of diuers partes or formes? In lyke maner when there can be giuen no contraryes of a thing, doubtles it were very ridiculous, to aÅ¿Å¿igne a queÅ¿tion to be diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed of contraryes.</p>
               <p>To be Å¿hort, there may happen alÅ¿o Å¿uch a theame, as may eaÅ¿ely be conueighed through all the orders of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tions, yet notwithÅ¿tandinge the godlye Preacher, foraÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as he enioyeth (as I Å¿ayde) frÃ©e lybertye, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in mature deliberation and in Å¿age aduice taking, among many choÅ¿eth not aboue two or thrÃ©e queÅ¿tions to be declared in the Å¿acred aÅ¿Å¿embly.</p>

               <p>Where fynally if it bee greatelye for the behoofe of the Churche to haue many queÅ¿tions expounded, yet Å¿hall it be the parte of a wiÅ¿e teacher to reÅ¿erue Å¿ome tyll an other time.</p>

In the firÅ¿t EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Corinthes cap. 15.</hi> it is proued by Å¿tronge argumentes that the deade doe all riÅ¿e or reuiue againe.

               <p>But out of this admonition touching the heaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of proofes or argumentes, to be Å¿kilfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently applyed to the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of which intreaty is made or to the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of the Church, floweth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exhortation, as holeÅ¿ome and neceÅ¿Å¿ary as any other.</p>
               <p>That is, that all men would wiÅ¿ely weigh and conÅ¿ider with themÅ¿elues, how farre forth it Å¿hall be expedient to vÅ¿e the holy Å¿ermons, whiche other haue made and Å¿etle forth.</p>
               <p>The cauÅ¿es of this exhortation when thou Å¿halt heare, whoÅ¿oeuer thou art, I knowe thou wilt pronounce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to bÃ©e iuÅ¿t and lawfull.</p>
               <p>WÃ©e Å¿e (which is greatly to bÃ©e marueled at) the miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters of Churches euery where to be Å¿o tied and faÅ¿tened wholly to the bookes that conteyne the diuine Å¿ermons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, with no litle Å¿tudy, by others, that by reaÅ¿on ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they neglecte to reade the Å¿acred Byble, there wanted litle but I had Å¿ayd, plainely contemne it.</p>
               <p>But it can not be diÅ¿Å¿embled, that the authors of thoÅ¿e Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons doe ofte times adnixe long and tedious digreÅ¿Å¿ions, alÅ¿o interlace without order reaÅ¿ons and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tes Å¿om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diÅ¿crepant from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿criptures openly recited: namely
<pb facs="tcp:22885:160"/>foraÅ¿much as they iudged them in eÅ¿pecially to be mÃ©ete and conuenient for the place and time.</p>
               <p>Now it can not be, that thoÅ¿e Å¿elfe Å¿ame thinges, Å¿houlde be apt and correÅ¿pondent to the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, wherein thou Å¿upplyeÅ¿t the office of teaching. Howbeit let vs admit that there be no digreÅ¿Å¿ions at all, and that the holy Å¿criptures are Å¿imply and Å¿incerely expounded in them: but what maketh that to thy purpoÅ¿e, I praye thÃ©e, if the whole explanation as it lyeth, be directed moÅ¿t chifely to thoÅ¿e poyntes of ChriÅ¿tian doctrine, whiche in thoÅ¿e places and times were in dÃ©ede very aptely and with great grace handeled of the Preachers, and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablye receiued of the hearers, where as nowe in theÅ¿e dayes and with thy audien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To what ende Å¿erueth the explication of that portion of Scripture, wherein are confuted the mayntayners and defenders of two contray beginninges the <hi>Manichees</hi> or other hereticks: whoÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿ertions haue now no where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place? What Å¿hall it profyt to inueigh againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that gad to the <hi>LyÅ¿tes</hi> or <hi>Theater</hi> to beholde playes and games, before that people whiche is vtterly ignoraunt what thoÅ¿e termes meane?</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is no poynt of wiÅ¿dome nor conuenient to vtter Å¿traight wayes euery thinge openlye (eÅ¿pecially in <hi>diuine</hi> matters) that is gathered together by the labour and iudgement of other men.</p>
               <p>For they doe alledge in dÃ©ede out of the Scriptures, Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, examples, proofes and probations of all Å¿orts, but foraÅ¿much as Å¿ome of them doe note the Å¿ame very brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and onely, as ye would Å¿aye, by poyntes or titles, Å¿ome alÅ¿o doe Å¿crape them together at all aduentures, out of others, whiche haue lykewiÅ¿e lately publiÅ¿hed and put forth Sermons: it is very requiÅ¿ite (except thou wilt caÅ¿t as well thy Å¿elfe as thy hearers into open daunger) that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t diligently examine euery thing, &amp; takynge a narrow new of the fountaines of Å¿cripture &amp; obÅ¿eruing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:22885:160"/>there all thinges that either goe before or followe after, what cauÅ¿es or circumÅ¿taunces hange together, agayne what driftes of reaÅ¿ons or arguments there be, &amp; what force they be off, determine finally with thy Å¿elf, whether they be agrÃ©eable to thy purpoÅ¿e, or no.</p>
               <p>And by the Å¿ame paynes taking that thou muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itie Å¿uÅ¿tayne in this behalfe, thou thy Å¿elfe mighteÅ¿t as wel after thine owne lykement deuiÅ¿e a new and entier Å¿ermon according to the Å¿tate of thinges preÅ¿ent. But (to draw to an ende) be it Å¿o, that thoÅ¿e Å¿traunge and forreine Sermons be in all reÅ¿pects perfect and Å¿ounde, and that there is nothing, as touching either matters or wordes, wanting in them: yet art thou very much deceyued, which Å¿uppoÅ¿eÅ¿t that thou Å¿halt with as good a grace Å¿ette foorth the doyngs of an other man, as thou vttereÅ¿t thine owne made at home in thy houÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>Labour, Å¿triue, enforce thy Å¿elfe Å¿o far as thy wittes wyll Å¿uffer, and yet truely will there neuer appere in thÃ©e that voyce, that plyauntnes of Å¿ounde, that moderation of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture and mouing, that grauitie, that ardent affection, that power and vehemency in words, which were found in the firÅ¿t author.</p>
               <p>Euery man is the beÅ¿t and moÅ¿t graue reciter of his owne doyngs. And the chiefe part of a Preacher, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with commendation is abÅ¿ent, when he wanteth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation.</p>
               <p>I omitte to tell that if it Å¿hall fortune any of thy hearers to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very Å¿ame author at home, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> thou borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t in a maner all thinges, it will come to paÅ¿Å¿e that in Å¿hort Å¿pace thou Å¿halt procure to thy Å¿elfe great haterd and contempt amongÅ¿t all men. I could my Å¿elfe (wil they Å¿ay) make as good a Sermon as our Preacher. I can read at home at my houÅ¿e euery day in the wÃ©eke al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he preacheth, neither is there any cauÅ¿e why I Å¿hould after this reÅ¿ort to the church.</p>
               <p>And by this meanes is enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dred in their minds a certein
<pb facs="tcp:22885:161"/>contempt of holy aÅ¿Å¿embelies, and by litle and litle all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall actions and the whole miniÅ¿tery of the Church begin to waxe vile and lothÅ¿om.</p>
               <p>Verily I belÃ©eue that thoÅ¿e which doe alwayes thus vÅ¿e, yea rather abuÅ¿e, the labours of other men, &amp; bring forth litle or nothing of their owne, are of <hi>Gregory Nazianze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> well and thriftely taunted and taken vp, where as in his <hi>Apologeticus</hi> he Å¿aith:</p>
               <q>If there be any peraduenture that haue learned two or thrÃ©e Å¿ermons, out of the auncient writers, and that haply more by hearing then by reading: Or in caÅ¿e we haue kanned a few <hi>PÅ¿almes</hi> hÃ©ere and there out of <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; afterward doe vÅ¿e them by apparelling them with a more fulÅ¿ome and well plighted veÅ¿ture, or if we can bragge and vaunt of PhyloÅ¿ophy euen to the Å¿tarres, counterfettinge a certaine Å¿hewe of godlyneÅ¿Å¿e, and diÅ¿guiÅ¿ing our face with Å¿uch like inuentions, we will now in all the haÅ¿te be prayÅ¿ed, and had in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we thinke now forthwith to be placed ouer Å¿ome peoples, we Å¿Ã©eme, in our owne fantaÅ¿y, euen from our cradels to be Å¿ome conÅ¿ecrated <hi>Samuels:</hi> We will alÅ¿o be counted wiÅ¿e and teachers of diuine miÅ¿teries, yea and Å¿et our Å¿elues amonge the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of law. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>And certes it is to to be lamented, that the labours of moÅ¿t excellent men repleniÅ¿hed with no leÅ¿Å¿e learninge then godly zeale, Å¿houlde be racked to a far other end and purpoÅ¿e, then the authors, when they put them forth, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they Å¿hould haue come.</p>
               <p>For we Å¿Ã©e how Å¿hamefully both the vnlearned and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do abuÅ¿e them alike.</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e verily, when by the helpe of them, they craftely and deceitfully intrude themÅ¿elues into the eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical function, for the which they are vnmÃ©ete, and theÅ¿e for that aÅ¿Å¿oone as they haue gotten them, they become all together Å¿luggiÅ¿he and Å¿louthfull, they neglect to peruÅ¿e
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:22885:161"/>the holy Å¿cripture and other godly bookes, they are not carefull, neither doe they once thinke any more to frame Å¿ermons by their owne with and labour.</p>
               <p>And yet it is moÅ¿t certaine, that the Å¿cope and meaninge of thoÅ¿e good men was not, to aduaunce and promote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dignitie any impudente, vnlearned and Å¿hameleÅ¿Å¿e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, or to maintaine the Å¿louth &amp; vnluÅ¿tines of any meane Å¿chollers, and of all other they ment leaÅ¿t to withdrawe any from the readinge of the canonicall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But this rather they alwayes wiÅ¿hed, and hoped by all meanes it woulde come to paÅ¿Å¿e, that the <hi>Lucubrations</hi> which they conÅ¿ecrated to the whole Church, and Å¿ubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the iudgement thereof, Å¿hould redounde alÅ¿o to the profit and vtilitie of all the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>And amongeÅ¿t other, their deÅ¿ire was chiefely to profite thoÅ¿e, that being called to the eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall miniÅ¿tery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with commendation to exerciÅ¿e themÅ¿elues therin, to the intent doubtleÅ¿Å¿e they might out of their moÅ¿t Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred workes gette a ready and familiar methode of <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> teachinge, to the intent they might learne apte and vÅ¿uall phraÅ¿es, the maner of findinge and diÅ¿poÅ¿inge all maner of proofes, of choÅ¿inge and applyinge common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to be Å¿horte, the order of mouinge of affectious: againe to the intent they might by their example be Å¿tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and prouoked to the continuall readinge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and ApoÅ¿tolick books, to the collection of apt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons and argumentes out of the Å¿ame, and to the diligent deuiÅ¿inge and framinge of Å¿acred Sermons.</p>
               <p>For like as thoÅ¿e me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that Å¿ell Sinamon, Galingale, nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migs, cloues and mace, and Å¿uch like Å¿traunge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Å¿pices, doe vÅ¿e to giue a peÃ©ce of euery of them for a taÅ¿te to the commers by to the intent they might the raher be allured to bye.

And Å¿o finally by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Å¿hall they be iudged, and that truely by the verdicte of the authors themÅ¿elues, rightly to vÅ¿e and enioye the laboures and trauiles of other men.</p>

               <p>For all theÅ¿e formes muÅ¿t we vÅ¿e when we take in hand to correct the maners and conditions of men. For why we perÅ¿wade and exhort that men leauinge vice woulde embrace vertue, we diÅ¿Å¿wade and dehort from thoÅ¿e thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are iuÅ¿tly to be reproued.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we blame the perÅ¿ons that are Å¿ubiect to any notorious vices, and we teache and commaunde theyr company and fellowÅ¿hip by al meanes to be auoided, we rebuke naughty and vncomely dÃ©edes, we reproue the thinges themÅ¿elues, namely all kindes of Å¿inne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

For what doe they elÅ¿e contayne, then grÃ©euous corrections, or reprehenÅ¿ions of vniuÅ¿t and iniurious dealinge? Of Å¿uch are a couple extant put forth of <hi>Gregory, Nazianzene,</hi> agaynÅ¿t <hi>Iulianus.</hi> Of the Å¿ame Å¿ort is there an Oration of <hi>ChriÅ¿oÅ¿tome,</hi> touching <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> the Martyr, As in which be contayned, alÅ¿o many things agaynÅ¿t the Å¿ayd <hi>Iulianus,</hi> which Oration not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding beareth the title not of an Homilie, but of a Booke.</p>

               <p>For where any thing is to be perÅ¿waded (as we Å¿ayde) by reaÅ¿on of the honeÅ¿ty, of the iuÅ¿tice and equity, of the Å¿urety, of the eaÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e thereof, and Å¿o foorth: in this kynde of Sermons verilye thou Å¿halte with no greate laboure diÅ¿Å¿wade any thinge, if in caÅ¿e thou canÅ¿te proue it to bÃ©e diÅ¿honeÅ¿t, vniuÅ¿te, iniuryous, perril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, diffyculte. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>For in dÃ©ede it ought to be the Å¿cope of all <hi>corrections,</hi> to bring men to the knowledge of their Å¿innes, to the intent that Å¿Ã©eing the greatneÅ¿Å¿e and filthynes therof, they might be touched with the care of their Å¿aluation, and brought to amendement of life.</p>
               <p>Wherfore what pointes Å¿oeuer be helpfull and neceÅ¿Å¿ary to this ende, whither they be taught in the workes of the <hi>Rhetoritians,</hi> or Å¿et foorth in the holy bookes of <hi>Diuines,</hi> Å¿hall aptely and rightely be applyed vnto this kinde of Sermons.</p>

               <p>For doubtleÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿pÃ©ech is a certaine portion of the life, and that truely not the leaÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>And ofte times by the Å¿pÃ©ech, is a great gheÅ¿Å¿e and iudgement giuen touchinge the whole inclynation and diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of a man.</p>
               <p>For it is playne and euident that puritie and Å¿implicitie ioyned with prudence and diÅ¿cretion, like as in life, Å¿o alÅ¿o in Å¿pÃ©ech or communication is commended of all men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Preacher muÅ¿t at all times, but then chiefely when hee beginneth firÅ¿t to exerciÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe in Teachinge the multitude, take diligent hÃ©ede, leaÅ¿t hÃ©e vÅ¿urpe any thinge in wordes, in pronunciation, or alÅ¿o in geÅ¿ture, which may brÃ©ede and ingender contempt of his perÅ¿on with the people.</p>
               <p>Wee haue Å¿Ã©ene them Å¿ometimes that haue Å¿o to often and in euery Sermon repeated Å¿ome one worde or Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, wee haue Å¿eene them that haue mingeled (euen to the lothÅ¿omnes of the hearers) tropes or figures, nothing fitte and correÅ¿pondent to the diuine matters which they had in hande, agayne wee haue seene them that
<pb facs="tcp:22885:194"/>in the hart of their matter haue vttered diuers times Å¿carce honeÅ¿t and comely motions.</p>
               <p>And theÅ¿e thinges miniÅ¿tered occaÅ¿ion to curious carpers and controllers of other mens doinges, to Å¿coffers and ieÅ¿ters amonge the rude Å¿orte, that when they were diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed to procure Å¿port and laughter in their iunkettinges and tipling feaÅ¿tes, they thought there could be no ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing for theyr turne, then cunningly and pleaÅ¿aunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repreÅ¿ent the wordes, the voyce, the geÅ¿ture of the Preacher.</p>

               <p>The one is, that whoÅ¿oeuer taketh in hand the function of preachinge doe foorthwith Å¿et before him Å¿ome one excellent EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Teacher, whoÅ¿e name is famous and renowmed, and who with Å¿inguler grace and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye expoundeth the Å¿acred Scriptures, in all reÅ¿pectes Å¿o far as may bÃ©e, to be imitated and folowed.</p>
               <p>For moÅ¿t commonly it commeth Å¿o to paÅ¿Å¿e, that what all men doe iudge worthy of commendation in an other that alÅ¿o thou mayelt allure thy Å¿elfe (if at leaÅ¿t thou feately and cunningly reÅ¿embleÅ¿t him in that point) will be well liked and well thought off in thÃ©e.</p>
               <p>Hee that applyeth diligence to the imitation and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an other man, it can not be choÅ¿en, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he Å¿hall at
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:22885:194"/>length obteyne Å¿ome of hys vertues, whom hÃ©e coueteth to bee like.</p>
               <p>And hÃ©e may alwayes finde Å¿ome one, or more, (yea euen nÃ©ere at hande alÅ¿o) right worthy to bÃ©e folowed &amp; imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which Å¿hall not bÃ©e an arrogant and partiall eÅ¿teemer of an other mans workemanÅ¿hippe.</p>
               <p>The other is, that the Preacher doe requeÅ¿t Å¿ome good man beinge of a Å¿ound and vncorrupt iudgement, that he would vouchÅ¿afe Å¿ometime to admoniÅ¿he him priuately, when he perceiueth any thinge in the Å¿peaker, that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth either the eares or eyes of the hearers, and that in his iudgemente wolde bÃ©e amended.</p>
               <p>Wee our Å¿elues doubtleÅ¿Å¿e are more blinde then BÃ©etles in notinge of our owne proper faultes, to omitte (in the meane time) that a number alÅ¿o doe euen when they commit offence, foliÅ¿hely fawne and flatter themÅ¿elues: but Å¿ome other truely doe eÅ¿pye many thinges, which eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vs, and can wiÅ¿ely diÅ¿cerne what pointes are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reprehenÅ¿ion in vs.</p>

               <p>Which thinge Å¿Ã©einge it is Å¿o, Å¿o far is it off, that the Preacher (if he bee a wiÅ¿e man) Å¿hould take the matter grieuouÅ¿ly to be after a friendly and ciuill Å¿ort comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of any man, that hÃ©e ought alÅ¿o to giue harty thankes to the comptroller, as vnto one (amonge Å¿ewe) that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him eÅ¿peciall good will and friendÅ¿hippe, couetinge by that meanes to prouide very commodiouÅ¿ly for his eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation and dignitie.</p>
