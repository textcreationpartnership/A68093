            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAuing accompliſhed &amp; gone through with all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyning to the edition of this former Booke, (right worſhipful) It was my hap to light vpon this Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ened in good &amp; pure Latine by Wigandus Orthius, as concerning the life &amp; death of the famous and worthy man D. Andrew Hyperius, author &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſer of the ſame Booke. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had once reade ouer, and finding it to be both pleaſaunt &amp; profitable, by reaſon as wel of the varietie of mater as alſo of the aptnes of the phraſe &amp; holeſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing againe that it might miniſter no ſmall occaſion to the Reader, whereby the better to like, not onely of this, but of all other the workes of this moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writer: I could by no meanes ſatisfie my ſelfe, till ſuch time as I had turned the ſame into our Engliſh tongue, and placed it (as a thing ſeuerall by it ſelfe) in the later ende of this volume. The thing it ſelfe (I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) is ſmal, but if the ſubſtance of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be conſidered, it may ſeeme (peraduenture) to be (I will not ſay great but) ſuch as neither the Reader ſhall haue cauſe to repent him off in reading, nor I cauſe to forethincke mee off in writing [Sed vino vendibili non eſt opus ſuſpenſa hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera,] Howbeit why I haue bene ſo bolde to put it foorth vnder the title of your name, as you (purcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) may maruaile, ſo haue I to render ſome reaſon. Firſt I was moued vnto it by the example of the penner of this Oration, who cauſing it to be fixed in the later ende of a worke begon &amp; not fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Author thereof D. Andrewe Hyperius, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led The Method of Diuinitie, dedicateth the ſame to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friende and Scholemaſter, Maſter Iohn Princierus. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I was induced ſo to do by the likenes &amp; reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the perſons: that is to ſay, of D. Andrew Hyperius, and D. Alexander Nowell: the one a famous Superintendente in Marpurge, a Citie of high Almayne, the other a moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Deane of the Cathedrall Church of S. Paule in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the one renowmed after his death for his rare gifts of learning
<pb facs="tcp:22885:3"/>&amp; godlines of life, the other yet liuing with no leſſe comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well as for his manifold knowledge in thinges diuine and humayne, as alſo for his ſinguler ornaments of Curteſye, Affabilitie, Modeſty &amp;c. The one a Mirrour of his time for his notable frugalitie &amp; ſobriety, the other a ſpectacle of our age for his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifulnes and good hoſpitalitie. But I cannot proſecute this point ſo far as I iuſtly might, conſidering tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> neither is it any part of my purpoſe to ſet foorth your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (otherwiſe then by occaſion) neither (I am ſure) conceyue you any pleaſure at all in hearinge of them: ſeeing you are wont to aſcribe al praiſe &amp; glory vnto god alone, &amp; vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing but ſhame &amp; confuſion. The third thing that alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to the doing of it, was the conſideration of the neere friendſhip &amp; familiaritie that remaineth betwene your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; that Reuerend father, my Lord of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherby I thought it not amiſſe (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering my dutie to both) to ioyne and lincke you together (as in one bande of amitie) ſo in one littell volume. Fourthly and laſtly, I was ſtirred or rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For which cauſes as you cannot be but greatly beloued of all in general &amp; of mee in ſpeciall, ſo couet I againe (by ſome meanes) to teſtifie the gratefull ſignification of my good meaning in this behalfe, which I cannot otherwiſe doe then by this ſimple demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of my good will and ready obſeruance toward you.

That which I ſpeake, to be true, you your ſelues know, moſt learned fathers, and can very well teſtifye: who haue heard him publikely teachinge, who haue heard him diſputinge with great commendation, who haue heard him familiarly talkinge with his friendes.</p>
            <p>Many other witneſſes there be thoroughout all Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manye, and other nations, men famouſly learned, which either reſorted to his <hi>Scoles,</hi> or other wiſe were more familiarly acquainted with him. His bookes are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that he wrote and publiſhed, which are of great learned men eſteemed and read amonge the workes of the beſt learned writers: as <hi>thoſe ſhort Scolies vppon the Epiſtle to the Romaynes:</hi> as, the <hi>two bookes Of framing of Diuine Sermons:</hi> as, the <hi>fower bookes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diuine:</hi> as, the <hi>two bookes Of reading and daily meditation of the holy Scriptures:</hi> as, that <hi>Cathechiſme</hi> or <hi>Shorte Inſtruction</hi> which he laſt put foorth.</p>
            <p>Many other bookes of his are witneſſes alſo, penned and written by him with great laboures and watchinges, which we are ſory could not of him be ouerſéene and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized: that ſo, which would haue turned to the great profit of all ſtudious <hi>Diuines,</hi> they might haue come abrode.

He had begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe to write <hi>12. bookes</hi> entituled <hi>of Scolaſticall vacations,</hi> &amp; as touching the <hi>Ordering of the Church 6. bookes.</hi> Which bookes, if he him ſelfe might haue corrected &amp; fully accompliſhed: then ſhould haue appered ſufficiently out of them his diuine wit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue ſhined foorth ſufficiently his notable learning, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue bene ſéene ſufficiently his wonderfull knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient hiſtories of the Church, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue bene apparant ſufficiently his grounded practiſe &amp; experience of manifolde things, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with his déepe &amp; excellent wiſdom. But euen out of thoſe notwithſtanding which he hath already put foorth, may all theſe thinges alſo be ſufficiently percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, though I ſhould holde my peace. We haue maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forſooth often times, whenſoeuer any thinge was propounded in familiar talke as touching <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> matters, to heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had alwaies in a readines out of auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hiſtories ſome thing that made for the mater in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; how he did ſo promptly illuſtrate &amp; determine the ſame. But there was no leſſe power in the man of teaching and arguing, then ther was furniture of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and erudition. With what force and facilitye be taught, the ſelfe ſame can teſtify, that are witneſſes before of his other gifts: what dexteritie in diſputing,
<pb facs="tcp:22885:10"/>what ſharpenes of witte he alwayes vſed, his bearers doe remember. He would not (as many are wont to do) dally and ſcoffe at the argumentes propoſed: neyther handeled he the matter with clamoures and outcryes, whereby no profit could redound to the hearers: but hée ſo openly and grauely diſcuſſed all thinges, that the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearers might receyue thereby moſt ample fruite. And in this his maner as well of teaching as of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he was alwaies from time to time of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtye, and of ſo great conſtancye: that neyther woulde he vnaduiſedly moue idle queſtions, neyther alter or interrupt the order of teaching that he had once with iudgement taken in hande. As touching which thing, you remember I am ſure, right learned Maſter <hi>Chun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade Mathew,</hi> my very worſhipfull kinſeman, what he ſayd the ſelfe ſame daye he let his lyfe, either of vs both you and I being preſent with him. <hi>I, ſayeth he, haue alwayes bene carefull of this in the Schole, that I might propound profitable doctrine to my hearers, and auoyde idle and ſuperfluous queſtions: I haue taken diligent heede, leaſte I ſhould giue anye occaſion of contentions, and haue euermore reteyned one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme order of teaching: and ſo long as I liue, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne.</hi> Theſe in a maner were his wordes: which when we had heard not without teares, we affirmed that we were witneſſes of that matter: and how that we lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had alwaies hitherto kept the fame order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and would kéepe alſo hereafter. But as touching that which perteyneth to his fidelitie and diligence, in the office of teaching, there is no cauſe why I ſhoulde ſaye much. I appeale to the felfe ſame to teſtifie of his diligence that were witneſſes euen now of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abilitye in teaching. This is certaine, he was rauiſhed with ſo great zeale and feruencie in promoting the ſtudies of holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that ouer and beſides the laboures y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> were enioyned him, he would also ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hooſe to himſelfe vacant houres, wherin he might teach
<pb facs="tcp:22885:10"/>ſomething extraordinarily. He dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly procured and ſet forward the exerciſes of <hi>diſputations</hi> and <hi>declamations,</hi> wherein as he alone by the ſpace of certaine yeres was alwaies w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great trauayle the chiefe: ſo afterward when other of vs alſo his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions kept our courſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order, he was both willingly and commonly preſent.</p>
            <p>As for the forme &amp; maner of preaching in the <hi>Schole,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what great laboure, I pray you, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what great payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes did he order it? He preſcribed common places, which he thought moſt néedeful to be handeled: he correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Sermons</hi> written by <hi>Studentes,</hi> before they were recited: he hearde alſo them that were appoynted to preach, before they ſhould openly come into the <hi>Church:</hi> to the intent that if any thinge were amiſſe either in their voyce, or in their geſtures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alſo might be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. He praiſed thoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had wel behaued themſelues in theſe exerciſes: he reproued and pricked forwarde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> negligent and ſlouthfull vnto diligence. He had adioyned to theſe kindes of exerciſes, beſides an <hi>Examining</hi> in matters of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> which he appointed once commonly in two yeres, a certain order alſo of <hi>Diuine Conſultation:</hi> where ſome queſtion béeing propofided either of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or of <hi>rites</hi> and matters <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> he would bid euery one in order to put foorth his opinion in a full &amp; continewed forme of ſpeaking: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent that ſo by diuers &amp; ſundrye ſentences on either ſide giuen, it might be perceyued out of many what was true, &amp; what falſe, what made for the pourpoſe, and what might be ſayd againſt it. All which labours be ſo willingly tooke vpon him, that hauing alſo no rewarde appointed for his paynes, he neuertheleſſe moſt diligently proſecuted the ſame. I omit his priuate ſtudies, of which I will now ſay nothing more, then that which I may truely auouch: namely, that he was neuer at home alone, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he either wrote ſomething, or read ſomething, or meditated ſomething: ſo far foorth that bée ſéemed vnto me euen to weaken and debilitate the
<pb facs="tcp:22885:11"/>ſtrength of his body, and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conſume him ſelfe with ouer great ſtudies and laboures. There was in him beſides all theſe thinges, a moſt diligent meditation touching the reforming of Churches, wherein he was occupied day and night. For he coueted greatly to reuoke the people of our Nation to the paterne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityue Church: he coueted to remoue many tryfles, which béeing deriued from the <hi>Papa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In which his holy purpoſe how farfoorth he trauailed, and how great fruite he miniſtred vnto all <hi>Churches,</hi> we ſhall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderſtand, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as, he béeing now dead &amp; gon, theſe meditations (of which alſo we haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome ynckeling before) although vnperfect, ſhall come into light. Concerning which thinges much more might of one be ſayde, and that with great commendation, but that I haſten to the other partes of my <hi>Oration.</hi> In prayſing therfore the lyfe and maners of this moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and excellent man, there is no cauſe why I ſhould much ſtand, eſpecially before you and in your preſence. He was ſufficiently knowen vnto you all, euen ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers alſo knew ſufficiently the ſtate of his lyfe. In dyet and apparell he was alwayes moſt temperate, in feaſting moſt ſober, in talke and dealing moſt friendly and iuſt. As he deteſted from his hart thoſe vnſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quaffinges and vncomely ſpéeches commonly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of our Countrymen at the time of their bancque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges: ſo againe would he now &amp; then be willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the moderate feaſtes and pleaſaunt méetinges of his friendes. Thus, he neither allowed of the things that were vnſéemely: nor diſallowed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things that might be graunted to the honeſt recreation of the mynde. To be ſhort, he ſo behaued himſelfe in
<pb facs="tcp:22885:11"/>all places and towarde all men, that his maner ſéemed not onely pleaſaunt to the learned, but alſo moſt ſwéete and delectable to the rude and ignoraunt. By reaſon whereof, how déere he was not onely to our <hi>Scole,</hi> but alſo to the whole citie, the manyfold teares of all ſortes of people which your eyes haue ſéene ſhed at the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his buriall, doe ſufficiently declare. But when as by the ſpace of 22. yeres, and odde monethes, he had in ſuch order as wée haue ſaid, behaued him ſelfe: as he was a man of no great health, ſo when he had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certain wéekes before with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual rhewmes and coughes, the xxiii. day of <hi>Ianuarye</hi> he began to wax ſore ſicke and to kéepe his bedde. He complayned moſt chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the paynes of his head, breaſt and ſides: and nowe and then all his members ſo burned, that they ſéemed to be ſhaken with a certaine quiuering or trembling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. And verily all that wéeke, when as yet we did not diſpayre of his lyfe, he talked &amp; conferred many things both with others, &amp; alſo eſpecially with mée who was of euer preſent with him, as touching matters pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Scole,</hi> as touching Diuine ſtudies, as touching the reformation of Churches. He ſayd amongeſt other thinges, that there ſhould order be taken, if he liued, for the pertition of certaine labours betwixt vs, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of ordering of Sermons: which for bicauſe he had hitherto ſuſteined alone, he thought that he had loſt his health. Now the <hi>30.</hi> day of <hi>Ianuarie</hi> which was the <hi>Lordes</hi> day, when the <hi>Lordes</hi> ſupper was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſacred aſſembly, he deſired that the holy bread and cuppe might, after the cuſtome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient church, be brought alſo vnto him. Of which after that he with his familie had taſted, he grew now more ſicker tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before. And then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day following, he began diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue in charge to his wife, what he would haue done after his death: and to commaunde his children that they ſhould behaue themſelues both towards <hi>God</hi> and their mother godlily, and towardes all other vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
<pb facs="tcp:22885:12"/>and honeſtly. Amongeſt the reſt, when a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boye of his, of thrée yeres old, ſtoode by his beddes ſide: Learne, ſaith he, <hi>my childe, the commaundementes of the Lorde, and hee ſhall take care of thee.</hi> After much talke had, he entreated diligently with thoſe that for duties ſake came to viſit him, as touching the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fayth, and the conſtancy of that doctrine which he had taught. And truely the very firſt day of <hi>Februarie,</hi> wherein alſo he departed, all his talke was altogether in this, that he might teſtifie vnto thoſe whome he ſawe preſent: that he remayned euento the laſt gaſpe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and inflexible in that profeſſion of fayth &amp; doctrine, which he ſo many yeres had profeſſed in the <hi>Scole.</hi> As touching which point I might now make a further diſcourſe, moſt excellent fathers, but that the teares for remembraunce of theſe things breake foorth from mine eyes. About the euening of the ſame day, when hee had once againe ſpoken ſome things touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his faith and perſeuaraunce therein: he began to take his leaue of vs, and euen to labour for lyfe. Yet knewe he ſtill euery man, and being required would make anſwere wyth broken wordes and dying ſpeches: till after 8. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clocke at night, when it was about halfe an houre to 9. hee gaue vp his ſpirit vnto God: hauing not as yet fully fyniſhed the 53. yeare of his age.</p>
            <p>You haue the hiſtory of the life &amp; death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt graue and reuerend Diuine <hi>D. Andrew Hyperius:</hi> which, as I coulde, I haue both briefely and ſimply declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
            <p>I come nowe to our mourning &amp; heauines, right worſhipfull fathers: which as it is wonderfull great and incredible, ſo can it not bée lawfull and iuſt, vnleſſe wée were moued with moſt weighty cauſes to the moſt: bitter ſenſe and ſorrowe of our mindes. Men are wont for two cauſes eſpecially to mourne at <hi>Funerals.</hi> Firſt, forſomuch as they ſuppoſe them to be euill dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whom they bewayle being deade. Secondly for
<pb facs="tcp:22885:12"/>bicauſe they recount with themſelues what great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities doe redounde by their death, either priuately to themſelues or publickely to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. The former cauſe taketh no place in our heauines: the later miniſtreth vnto vs ſadnes moſt ſorrowfull. For wée are not either enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geled with that error that we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the minde to bée extinguiſhed together with the body: Or wée are not ſo vngodly, as to doubt of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicitie, which after this life all that haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with faith and a good conſcience ſhall enioye. Naye verily wée are reſolued by a moſt certaine and iuſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that our deare <hi>Hyperius,</hi> as hée alwaies liued a godly and holy life, ſo hath he now the full fruition of the moſt ſwéete and comfortable preſence of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, the company and fellowſhip of Angels, and the ſocietie of holy and bleſſed men. Neither truely doe wée ſuppoſe that there was in him either any ſuch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or loue of this life, as that wée ſhould thinke him to dye with deſire of a longer life. He ſawe well ynough, with what great cares this miſerable life was repleniſhed: he knewe well ynough, that ſo long as we continew in this tabernacle, wee are wanderers from the Lorde: he was not ignoraunt that the godly being looſed from the bond of this fleſh, doe go vnto the <hi>Lord.</hi> Wherefore, albeit he was in ſuch wiſe conuerſaunt in huge and mighty labours, that he was not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time greatly grieued with the tediouſneſſe of this lyfe: yet notwithſtanding was he caryed continally with a longing deſire of the immortall and euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lyfe.

               <hi>conſtellations</hi> of the ſtarres, as they call them: but out and from the conſideration of the thinges themſelues, which were open and apparaunt in the ſight of all men. He ſayd that kingdoms and Empires were neuer ſo ill eſtabliſhed in the time of our aunceſtours, as they were now for the moſt part. For ſome were holden of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: ſome were gouerned by Women: other ſome ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by yonge men, which were newly come to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them the charge of the <hi>Common wealth.</hi> Hée af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmed that there were in déede ſome Princes remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in gouernment, but very fewe, both graue in yeres, and alſo expert in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of thinges, which did as it were ſtill euery way suſteine with their ſhoulders the whole weight and burthen of the <hi>Empyre.</hi> Hée remembered the <hi>Scoles</hi> ſcattered and torne in ſunder throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> either by ciuill warres, or by the wofull perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Godly, or by the death &amp; decay of famous and worthy Teachers. He ſhewed the ſtate of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, how miſerably they were afflicted, as well for that they were béereft of their notable Paſtors &amp; Doctors, whoſe like were not to be founde to ſuccéede them: as alſo bicauſe they were vexed with ſtraunge and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcordes: and further that ſuch were the times now and maners of men, that it ſéemed that almighty God very ſhortly, being prouoked with our manifold enormities, would take away his kingdome from vs, &amp; giue it vnto others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould bring foorth more worthy fruites. Theſe things did he vſe as wel, at other times often to recount, &amp; to wiſh of God that he might firſt bée taken out of this life before he ſhould fall into that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation &amp; confuſion of all things, which he in minde foreſawe: as alſo immediately after the firſt time when he began to kéepe his bedde, he ſayd thus vnto mée ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting nothing as yet as touching his death: <hi>There is nothing, quoth he, that may delight mee any more in this preſent lyfe. Therefore I will moſte willingly,
<pb facs="tcp:22885:13"/>whenſoeuer it ſhal pleaſe the Lorde, giue ouer the ſame, that I may goe vnto Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore like as he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not for any longer lyfe: ſoo, whither wée haue an eye to that which hée here lefte behinde him, or conſider what he hath obteined after his death: who would not thincke that he is both very well prouided for, and alſo in happy and bleſſed eſtate? Hée hath eſcaped the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and calamities of this wretched lyfe: he enioyeth nowe perpetuall and neuer chaunging delightes with Chriſt. Hée hath put off that body of his, ſubiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: He loketh now to put on a body immortall &amp; incorruptible. He hath forſaken theſe <hi>Scoles</hi> of ours: he is admitted into the <hi>Scole</hi> of heauen. Whom here he ſawe as it were in a glaſſe by a darke ſpeaking: him now he beholdeth face to face. The crowne of glory that neuer ſhall decaye, which he alwayes in the whole courſe of his ſtudies and laboures trauayled vnto: is now giuen vnto him of the Lorde, wherein he tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth and reioyceth. Wherefore wée are not ſtricken into this plight and heauines, for that or as though wée thought him to be loſt or in euill caſe: but for bycauſe we ponder in our mindes, what great dommage and detriment wée haue both priuately and publickely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by his death. Neither truely is our priuate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie boyde of ſorrowing in this caſe. For if I ſhould ſaye, that I were nothing moued with the death of my moſt excellent kinſeman, nothing touched with the heauy chéere of mine Aunt, nothing grieued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dolfull diſtreſſe of my Couſens: howe rightly I ſhould doe it, I leaue it to the ſtern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that we haue rightlye and properlye recited and digeſted theſe ſaid places, this may be a proofe, that the Apoſtle writinge to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (whom he had ordayned biſhops and teachers in the Churches of of God) inculketh euery where the ſame, and with lyke diligence vndoubtedly commandeth them to be vrged and inculked of others.

And what, if by handling of hard and difficult places ſome perill commeth rather to be feared, then profit and commoditie to be looked for? for in déede, when ſome curious hearers begin once to caſt in their minds how with ſtudy and dilygence they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the miſteries of diuine matters, this commonlye commeth in vre: that by long and much ſearching they fal into errours, and whilſt they call to remembraunce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſundry interpretations, they conceiue ſtraunge and phantaſticall opinions, whiche immediatelye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they obſtinatly holde and defende, and to the great hurt and diſturbance both of them ſelues, &amp; alſo of others, yea of the whole church, they delight to diſpearce them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the vnlearned.

               <p>The effecte of our meaninge, is this: Thou expoundeſt ſome entier booke of Scripture, or ſome parte of a booke: in the wordes that come nexte to hande, are founde (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture) touched diuers and ſondry profitable places,

               <p>Examples thou mayſt finde not rare in <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and other eccleſiaſticall writers.</p>
               <p>By theſe things it is euidently to be perceyued, in what parte of the Sermon affections ought to be moued.

Howbeit, in whatſoeuer exhortations, reprehenſions or obiurgations it be, that place ought chiefely and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bée giuen to the mouinge of affections of myndes, it is much better knowen, then that it is needefull here to bée admoniſhed, the dayely cuſtome of teachers in the Churche not obſcurely, prouinge and confirminge the ſame.</p>

               <p>Firſt, by the dilligent conſideration of the things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are before his eyes as namely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man very exactly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb facs="tcp:22885:60"/>and enſercheth in his mynde, all and euery point an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the matter it ſelfe. Which thinge neuertheleſſe cannot bée done but of him, that knoweth perfectly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kynde of the buſineſſe in hande.</p>
               <p>Secondely, by a vehement imagination or fantaſy, when a man with moſt atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apprehendeth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paynteth to himſelfe the formes and ſimylitudes of the thinges whereof hée entreateth, which afterwarde he ſo fixeth &amp; ſetleth in his minde, as if his owne priuate cauſe were in handling, and as though hee ſhoulde perpetually muſe vppon that thinge alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe thinges are furthered, yea, and increaſed alſo, if a man ſhall attentiuely reade and peruſe ſome one place (eſpecially) in the ſacred Scriptures, wherein the affections are iudged to be moſt cunningely and artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moued: in which it ſhall bée conuenient ſo longe time to ſtaye, as the mynde may fully conceyue thoſe thinges that agrée with the purpoſe.

Fourthly, in cace thou deſireſt earneſtely to be moued and affected thy ſelf, it is requiſit that thou laboure to obteine that of God, (who turneth and enforceth the hartes of men at his pleaſure) and ſaye wyth the Plalmiſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note>

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">IIII</note> moſt effectually of all doe they moue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mindes of men, to whom is giuen of God that vertue or power of ſpirit in Teaching, which wee ſayd, in the ſecond Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this preſent Booke, to be moſt requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to euery Preacher.

For we know by experience that ſome commonly ſpeake atogither without arte, and very ſimply and plainely, and yet in the meane tyme doe drawe their hearers whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they lyſt. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And herevppon it commeth to paſſe, that in Thappoſtles ſpeakinge ſo ſimpely and playnely, (I had almoſte ſayde alſo rudely and diſordredly) is ſo ofte tymes commended

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22885:70"/>And it were a great offence to paſſe ouer thoſe reaſons and common places vndiſcuſſed, whiche are openly touched in the ſcriptures read before.

               <p>For ſomtimes, many &amp; diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon places are noted in the ſcripture recited, conteyning very godly and profitable matter, but amongſt them all onely a few ſuppoſed to bee moſt fruitfull, are with as great induſtrye as may be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>Somtime the whole explanation of Scripture, is aptly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed into two or thrée chapters, or partes, or common places (it maketh no great matter how we tearme them).

               <p>Agayne on the other ſide, there is ſpecial conſideration where lawfull <hi>confirmation</hi> may ſeaſonably be admitted.

               </p>
               <p>And (that I may ſpeake briefely) if the matter ſo requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that a Booke of Scripture, or any parte thereof be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the people, there is no place left vnto <hi>confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>

               <p>Examples not a few are to be founde in the later partes of the epiſtles of Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> in whiche the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for the moſt part contendeth, that it behoueth thoſe that are once iuſtifyed by faith to paſſe all their whole liues in godly conuerſation and honeſty.</p>
               <p>That thing is witneſſed in the epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes. Cap. 12.13.</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe in the epiſtle to the <hi>Galat.</hi> in part of the <hi>cap. 5.</hi> and <hi>cap. 6.</hi> the whole, to the <hi>Epheſians. cap 4.5.6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where as be not ſuch apparaunt exhortations, but haply ſome ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are declared, there may neuertheleſſe raſely be gathered out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame thoſe thinges that conduce to the right inſtitution of life.</p>
               <p>That thing is moſt conueniently brought to paſſe, when the vſe of euery ſentence or aſſertion is brought to light, ſo farre forth as it is applied to the common courſe of mans life.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Romans. 6.</hi> teacheth vs this ſentence, ſaying:
<pb facs="tcp:22885:73"/> 
                  <hi>We ought not to abuſe the grace of God to the lilbertie of ſinne.</hi> He addeth a reaſon on the contrary part: <hi>Becauſe we are dead vnto ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proofe of the ſame reaſon followeth of the effect and ende of Baptiſme. <hi>In Baptiſme we renownce and dye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne,</hi> By and by he annexeth an exhortation or inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deriued out of the proper vſe of the ſame aſſertions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euen ſo we alſo</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>ought to walke in newneſſe of lyfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agayne the Apoſtle confirminge the ende or effect of Baptiſme, by a reaſon taken of the efficatie of Chriſtes death, ſaith, that <hi>death was vtterly vanquiſhed of Chriſt, &amp; that it hath no more power ouer hym.</hi> Which truely ought to bee taken for a principle.</p>
               <p>Then forth with the Apoſtle herevppon ſorteth out an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution meruaylouſly to the purpoſe. <hi>Let not ſinne</hi> (ſaith hée) <hi>raigne in your mortall bodye.</hi> To the ſame effecte when one hath explaned the doctrine touchinge the will of man, and the weakenes of our owne ſtrenght, he ſhall w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good right and this, that we are to bée inſtructed and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by that generall ſentence, howe wee ought (acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our ſo great infirmitie) to bee humble and méeke, not to ſtande high in our owne conceytes, to attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge vnto our ſelues, to depende wholly vppon God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which gouerneth our will and actions, and finally to looke for all good thinges of him alone. In whiche behalfe, wée maye ſée ſome thinges heaped together of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things (vndoubtedly) bée of great importaunce to the information of life in rightuouſnes, as euery man may perceyue.</p>

               <p>Of this diuerſitie, therefore, it ſéemeth good vnto mee, to entreate by putting forth ſome examples, to the intents they may come forth prepared and furniſhed to all aſſayes, that wil endeuour themſelues to execute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offices &amp; duties
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22885:83"/>of an Euangelicall Teacher. But before all thinges, wée will bringe them, as it were by the hande, vnto this poynte that euery man may eaſely perceyue, howe and after what ſorte, when a parte of holy Scripture is offred to be explaned, many and diuers common places may be drawen and noted out of the ſame, againe how ſome may with iudgement bée ſelected out of them, and ſomwhat more dillygently be declared before the multitude.<note place="margin">Partes two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde in the ſacred Scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The partes of holy Scripture are accuſtomed to bee ſet forth in two ſortes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1</hi> The one conſiſteth in a continuall hiſtoricall narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which notwithſtandinge ſomwhere appeareth that which doth not obſcurely argue, to what kynde of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the ſame ought to bée aſcribed.</p>
               <p>For in déede the moſt parte of the narrations in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes doe perteyne to the kynde <hi>didaſcalick,</hi> forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they doe chiefely eſtabliſhe this doctrine, to wit, that, Ieſus is Chriſt, that is to ſay, the true Meſſins and true God, by whom; whoſoeuer beléeue us him, doe aſpire to eternall ſaluation Which doctrine or generall ſentence, to be the common ſcope of the Euangelicall narrations, <hi>Iohn Cap. 20.</hi> hath expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2</hi> The other ſorte is, when all that parte is ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpente and conſumed in teachinge, namely ſo, as with argumentes diſtinct, and one followinge an other, and directed to one and the ſelfe ſame ende, a certayne ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or aſſertion is there handeled and ſet forth.</p>
               <p>Example may bée taken out of the fourth Chapiter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romaynes.</hi> No man ſéeth not in all that Chapiter diuers proofes and reaſones to bée packed togither, whereof euery one proueth a man to bée iuſtified by fayth without workes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that the ſame Chapiter is of the kynde <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſcalick,</hi> ſéeinge ſuch a doctrine is there plainely confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, eche man may eaſely iudge.</p>
               <p>Of either parte of the ſacred Scriptures, it ſhall bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite at this preſent that wée note ſo much as we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:22885:84"/>thinke méete and ſufficient.<note place="margin">Common places, hovve &amp; after vvhat ſort to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of which ſort ſoeuer it ſhall fortune the holy reading to bée offred, it is neceſſary that hee which is deſpoſed to gather and excerpte common places, before all thinges doo peruſe ouer the wholle once and peraduenture twyſe or thriſe, till ſuch tyme, as he may well conceyue the ſimple meaninge of the wordes.</p>
               <p>Then let him returne backe to the canueſſinge of all the partes and members, and ſtayinge a littell at euery of them, let him conſider, and weigh more déepely with him ſelfe, whither any thing may bée drawen out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of the ſame member perteyninge, either vnto doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſaye, the confirmation of true aſſertions, or to the <hi>redargution</hi> of falſe opinions, or to the inſtitution of lyfe in rightuouſneſſe, or to the correction of vniuſte dealinge, or laſtely vnto conſolation.</p>
               <p>For as wée haue before ſpecified, it behoueth theſe fyue generall Diuine places of inuention of bée continuallye conuerſaunt in our myndes, as thoſe that ſufficienely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare of themſelues, howe wée oughte to ſearch, diſcloſe and pronounce common places conteyned in the wordes of Scripture, and in the ſentences of the wholle courſe of Chriſtian doctrine.</p>
               <p>For they are beyond meaſure plentifull, and doe eftſones bringe forth profitable common places, of all thinges, which are neceſſary to the perfection of a Chriſtian man. Neither occurreth any readinge of Scripture ſo barren and vnfruitefull, but that the wordes placed in the text, do miniſter ſom thing anſwerable to thoſe general places. But go to, let vs make a triall, and take in hande ſome examples of the former ſorte, which namely conſiſt in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall narrations, and let vs examyn them according to the ſayde fyue generall places of inuention. For when wée haue opened a way in the narrations hiſtorical, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſéemeth alwayes to be the greater difficulty, it will be an eaſy matter to go forwarde to the tractatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of examples of the other ſort, in which are ſimply declared aſſertions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:22885:84"/>of our religion.</p>
               <p>Let the hiſtory therefore bée recited out of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>Marc. Cap. 8</hi> which is this:<note place="margin">1. Example of the former ſorte.</note> 
                  <hi>When there was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greate company, and had nothinge to eate, Ieſus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge his diſciples vnto him, ſayth vnto them: I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion on the people, bycauſe they haue bene with mee nowe three dayes, and haue nothinge to eate: And if I ſende them awaye faſtinge to their owne houſes, they will faynte by the waye: for diuerſe of them came from farre. And his Diſciples aunſwered him: from whence can a man ſatiſfie theſe men with breade heere in the wildernes? And hee asked them: howe many loaues haue yee? They ſayde ſeuen. And he commaunded the people to ſit downe no the grounde. And he tooke the ſeuen loues, and when he had giuen thankes, he brake, and gaue to his diſciples, to ſet before them: and they did ſet them before the people. And they had a fewe ſmall fiſhes: and when he had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he commaunded them alſo to be ſet before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So they did eate and were ſuffiſed: and they toke vp of the broken meat, that was lefte, ſeuen-baskets full. And they that had eaten, were about fower thouſand: and he ſent them away.</hi>

               <p>Let vs ſée then vnto what kinde of Sermon this ſacred Leſſon is to be referred. That it is of the kinde <hi>didaſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> no man doubteth. For therefore are theſe notable miracles deſcribed and ſet ſorth, that all men might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to confeſſe, that Chriſt is true God, and that they might beléeue in him. For ſo <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in priſon heard of the doinges of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math, 11.</note> ſent his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples more truly for others ſakes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred: whither he were that promiſed &amp; of ſo long time loked for <hi>Meſsias,</hi> or no? But Chriſte aunſwered in ſuch wiſe, as he woulde haue it gathered by his workes, that he was in déed that promiſſed <hi>Meſsias</hi> and Sauiour.</p>
               <p>Yea, and els where Chriſt more then once or twiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to the ſame effect, that the workes which he did,<note place="margin">Ioan. 5.10.14.</note> teſtified of him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he was the ſon of god &amp; god himſelf.

                  <pb facs="tcp:22885:85"/>that Chriſt is the author of ſo greate a mirackle, that hée is the true <hi>Meſsias</hi> and very God, by whome all men may obteyne ſaluation through fayth.</p>
               <p>Nowe in paſſinge through all the members, and hauing reſpect euery where vnto thoſe fiue generall places of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, let vs dilligently enſerch, in that order which wée ſpake off,<note place="margin">Common places.</note> the ſondry common places of Chriſtian doctrine conteyned in the ſame.</p>

               <p n="2">

               <p>In lyke maner therefore ſhall the wyſe diſpenſer of gods holy worde, hauinge a dilligente conſideration of the perſons, tymes, and places, amongſte many places offringe themſelues, chooſe onely a fewe, ſuche namely as hée ſuppoſeth will bringe moſte profite to the Church, and the ſame ſhall bee more amply and playnely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane.</p>

               <p>In the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> it is learnedly declared, that Chriſt is both God the ſonne of God, and alſo man, and that two natures doe conſiſt in one perſon. Wherfore in the very entrye of the Epiſtle it is cléerely ſayde:</p>

               <p>For it is neceſſary that all thinges be directed to one and the ſame ſcope, which the Scripture it ſelfe propoſeth.</p>

               <p>For thus <hi>Iohn</hi> reaſoneth: He is God that can baptiſe with the holy ghoſte, that is, giue the holy ghoſte by his owne authorytie. But Chriſt can this doe, Chriſt therefore is God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is ſuppoſed to be manifeſt of it ſelfe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ſo great power can light vpon no man, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.

               <p>God the father of heauen whiche commaunded me to baptiſe, ſignifyed vnto me that he had power to giue the holy ghoſt, vpon whom the holy ſpirit ſhoulde deſende and abide in lykenes of a doue.</p>
               <p>But this ſigne I haue founde to be in Chriſt. Chriſt is he therfore that can giue the holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Wherfore if we duly weigh the matter, the diuinitie of Chriſt is here proued and commended by two ſignes. The one is, that the holy ghoſt came down vpon Chriſt, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on him. The other, that Chriſt baptiſeth with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt.</p>
               <p>In which two ſignes Chriſte incomparably excelleth all other creatures, and all ſorts of men though neuer ſo holy. For in déede the holy ghoſt in lyke maner commeth downe vpon other men, and yet doth not ſo abide in them, as that he alwaies worketh effectually in them.</p>
               <p>Inaſmuch as the Apoſtles themſelues, after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the holy ghoſt in a viſible forme, are read to haue bene touched ſomwhat with humaine infyrmities, &amp; that

               <p>Moreouer, men in déede doe baptiſe, but yet only with water, and adminiſtring no other thing then the outward ſigne: but Chriſt baptiſeth with the ſpirit, and miniſtreth inward and ſpyrituall effectes. It appeareth therefore ſufficiently that Chriſt by thoſe ſignes is declared to bée very God.</p>

                  <hi>It came to paſſe; that when the people preaſſed vppon him, to heare the worde of God, hee ſtoode by the lake of Genezareth, and ſawe twoo ſhippes ſtandinge by the lake ſide. But the fiſhermen were gone out of them, and were waſshinge their nettes. And he entred into one of the ſhippes, which perteyned to Simon, and prayed him that he would thruſte out a litle from the lande: and hee ſat downe, and taught the people out of the ſhippe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee had left ſpeakinge, hee ſaide vnto Simon: Launche out into the diepe, and let ſlippe your nettes to make a draught. And Simon anſwered, and ſaid vnto him: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wee haue laboured all nighte, and haue taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge: Neuertheleſſe at thy commaundement. I will loſe forth the nette. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had this done, they incloſed a great multitude of fiſshes: But their nette brake. And they beckened vnto their fellowes, which were in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhippe, that they ſhould come and helpe them: and they came, and filled both the ſhippes, that they ſuncke agayne. When Symon Peter ſawe this, hee feel downe at Ieſus knees, ſayinge: Lorde goe from mee, for I am a ſinfull man. For hee was vtterly aſtonied, and all that were with him, at the draught of fiſshes, which they had taken. And ſo was alſo Iames and Iohn the ſonnes of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee, which were parteners with Simon. And Ieſus ſaid vnto Simon: Feare not, from henceforth thou ſhalt catch men. And when they had brought vp their boates to the ſhore, they forſooke all, and followed him.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="4">IIII. As they by the worde of Chriſt were called to the Apoſtolike office, and quiclye folowed him, ſo oughte we

               <p>Let vs take in hande an other example not hiſtory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,<note place="margin">III. Example.</note> out of the epiſtle to the <hi>Romains</hi> the ſixte Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As many of vs as are baptized into Ieſus Chriſte, are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his death. Wee are buryed then with him by baptiſme into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the father, euen ſo wee alſo ſhould walke in newnes of lyfe. For if wee be grafte together in him by the likenes of his death: wee ſhall in like maner be partakers, of the reſurrection Knowinge this, that our olde man is crucifyed with him alſo, that the bodye of ſinne might vtterly bee deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerue ſin. For he that is deade, is iuſtified from ſinne. And if we bee deade with Chriſt, wee beleeue that wee ſhall alſo liue with him: knowinge that Chriſt beynge rayſed from the deade, dyeth no more: death hath no more power ouer him. For as touchinge that he died, he died concerninge ſin once: And as touching that hee liueth, hee liueth vnto god. Likewiſe reken your ſelues to be deade to ſinne, but aliue vnto God thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtate is:<note place="margin">State.</note> That thoſe which are once iuſtifyed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough faith and baptized into Chriſt, ought alwayes after to liue godly and Chriſtianly. Which thinge the apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo els where very often and with pithy reaſons auoucheth. This readinge therefore is aſcribed to the kinde <hi>didaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calick.</hi>

               </p>

<pb facs="tcp:22885:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his moſt pretious bloude and death, and as that which is neceſſary to all beleuers, foraſmuch as by it they are engraffed into the Churche of God, and by reaſon of it are named Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The effectes of baptiſme ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> exactely to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, eſpecially that by baptiſme we are made pertakers of the death of Chriſt, and of all the benefites deriued therefrom to the beléeuers: of which ſorte are remiſſion of ſinnes paſſed, lyfe, euerlaſting ſaluation &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreouer that it behoueth all thoſe that are baptized, to dye vnto ſinne, and liue only vnto rightuouſnes. For thus the Apoſtle reaſoneth: All we which are baptized, are made pertakers of the death of Chriſt. But Chriſt dying, dyed vnto ſinne. Therefore are we alſo by baptiſme deade vnto ſinne. And if we be deads vnto ſin, it were very conuenient for vs to couet to liue againe therevnto. And certes it is true that, we in baptiſme do dye vnto ſinne, and ſinne dyeth vnto vs: foraſmuche as in baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me all our ſinnes are waſhed awaye, and the holy Ghoſt is giuen vnto vs, by whom bothe the force of ſinne and concupiſcence is reſtrained, and repreſſed, and we not onely are induced to well dooing, but alſo are vehemently holpen forward.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe alſo all, afore they be baptized, doe openly before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of God, forſake the world, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel that brought ſinne into the worlde, to the intent they might therby declare, that they will hereafter haue no maner of thinge to doe with them, but will inſtitute a newe and holy kinde of life.</p>
               <p n="3">III. they that are once babtized into Chriſt ought highly to eſtéeme all thinges, that are put forth as touchinge Chriſt, foraſmuch as Chriſt is giuen vnto vs not onely to paye the price of our redemption out of the power of the diuell, and alſo to be an example, and whom wée ſhould with al our endeuoure imitate and folowe, in thoſe thinges ſpecially which may be conuenient for vs.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22885:123"/>Hitherto perteyne the two reaſons, whereby the Apoſtle plainly proueth, that we, for that we are baptized, ought to be dead vnto ſinne. The one is taken of the effect and finall cauſe of the death of Chriſt. You knowe (ſaith he) that this is the proper effect and ende of Chriſtes death, that ſinne is aboliſhed, &amp; that to thintent we ſhould not ſerue it any more.</p>
               <p>But this effect of Chriſtes death he ſéemeth to deſpiſe, whoſoeuer after remiſſion of ſinnes once receiued, wyll returne againe vnto ſinne. Wherefore it is neceſſary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that we remayne ſtyll dead vnto ſinne. The other reaſon is deriued of a ſimilitude, as touchinge ciuill ſeruitude, which by the comminge of death taketh an ende.</p>
               <p>As he that ciuilly is a bondeman, ſo ſoone as he dyeth, is deliuered from his power to whome hée was bounde: Euen ſo we which were the bondeſlaues of ſinne, ſéeinge in baptiſme we dye once with Chriſt, ought by no meanes to ſerue ſinne any more.</p>
               <p>Here therefore is ſet forth vnto vs the example of Chriſt himſelfe, whom both in dyinge once vnto ſinne and liuinge againe vnto roghtuouſenes, we ought to imitate and folowe. By this dilygent imitation we ſhall both be called and be in very deade perfect Chriſtians.

               <p>I ſuppoſe therfore that thoſe whom we haue taken in hand to inſtruct, can not iuſtly complaine, that they want any excelent authors, whoſe counſayles and ſteppes they may followe.</p>
               <p>But to procéede, the partes, after they be in this ſorte once noted and diſpoſed, they are accuſtomed ofte times to explane more at large, namely by inferringe as well proofes and ſentences, as alſo apte hiſtoryes out of the ſtore houſe of the holy Scriptures: Moreouer, by applying ſimilitudes, compariſons, and whatſoeuer els is of that kinde profitable to teach, illuſtrat, &amp; moue: all which things (ſo far forth as may bee) they adioyne to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of the hearers and to the preſent ſtate of thinges.

               <p>
                  <hi>Two of the diſciples of Ieſus went that ſame daye to a towne which was from Hieruſalem about threeſcore fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes, called Emaus. And they talked together of all theſe thinges that were done. And it came to paſſe, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned together, and reaſoned, that Ieſus himſelfe drewe nere, and wente with them. But their eyes were holden, that they coulde not knowe him. And he ſayde vnto them: What maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications are theſe that ye haue one to an other, as yee walke, and are ſadde?</hi>

                  <hi>And the one (named Cleopas) anſwered and ſaid vnto

And they ſaide vnto him: of Ieſus of Nazareth, which was a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet, mightie in deede &amp; in word before God, and all the people. And how the high prieſtes, and our rulers deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be condemned to death, &amp; haue crucified him. But we truſted that it had bene he which ſhould haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Iſrael: and as touching all theſe thinges, to daye is the third day, that they were done. Yea and certaine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among vs made vs aſtonied, which came earely to the ſepulchre, and when they found not his body, they came ſaying, that they had alſo ſeene a viſion of angels, whiche ſaide that he was aliue. Therfore certaine of them which were with vs, went to the ſepulchre, and founde it euen ſo as the women had ſaid, but him they ſawe not. Then he ſaide vnto them: O fooles and ſlow of harte to beleeue al that the Prophets haue ſpoken. Oughte not Chriſte to haue ſuffered theſe thinges, and to enter into his glorye? And he began at Moyſes, and at all the prophetes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretd vnto them in all the ſcriptures, the thinges which were writen of him. And they drewe neere to the towne, which they went vnto, but he made as though hee woulde haue gone further. But they conſtrained him, ſaying: Abide with vs, for it draweth towards night, and the day is farre ſpent. And ſo he went in to tary with them.

<pb facs="tcp:22885:132"/>remembred thoſe thinges by which men of all former ages haue bene moſt chiefely perſwaded, to imbrace, and highly eſtéeme, the holeſome doctrine of the Church, compriſed in the volumes of the prophetes and Apoſtles. And thus much touching this euangelicall narration of <hi>Mark 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are in the thirde Chapter aforegoing certaine readinges out of the Euangelicall hiſtory, explaned of vs in ſuch order as we there handeled and ſet foorth: and yet nothing letteth, but that the very ſame, may no leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably then godly, be expounded alſo in this forme wherof we nowe entreate. Which thing truly I will not ſticke héere briefely to declare.</p>
               <p>That narration out of <hi>Mark. 6.</hi> as touching the multitude which was thrée dayes without méate through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſyre they had to hére y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt holy ſermons of Chriſt, doth firſt of all wonderfully commend vnto all men y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtudye of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vnderſtanding the worde of God. Therfore we ſhall worthily accept this ſentence in ſteade of the ſtate. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond place is added y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which declareth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> al thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are touched with any deſyre at al of profiting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of true religion are cared for of god, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god will in no wiſe forſake them. I <hi>haue compaſsion</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>on the multitude.</hi> Thirdly, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of the diſciples ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge that it coulde not be that ſo many might be ſatiſfied with breade in the wildernes, may bée gathered: that thoſe which prepare themſelues to the ſtudy of ſacred and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thynges, are firſt hindered and oppreſſed with many griefes and temptations, before they can attayne to their wiſhed ſcope, yea and ofte times they ſtrike vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rockes (as they ſaye) euen in the very heauen it ſelfe, and are haled awaye from their godly purpoſe. But whereas chriſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth place demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of his diſciples how ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny leaues they haue, we are taught euidently thereby, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God hath alwayes in a readines diuers apte and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient meanes, whereby he may prouibe for the godly, &amp; next after ſpirituall or heauenly benefytes miniſter alſo corporall or earthly.</p>
               <p>For by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we leaſt thinke off, god ſuccureth all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22885:132"/>thoſe that labour and be in neceſſitie. And therefore in the fyfte place Chriſt giueth vnto his diſciples, that they ſhoulde ſet before others. for God ſendeth alwayes in ſeaſon teachers, which maye with all fydelitie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence enſtructe thoſe that are deſirous to learne. Laſtely and in the ſixt place; they all eate and are ſuffyſed.</p>
               <p>They that a litle before hongered and thriſted after the knowledge of the trueth, doe now happely profyt therein, yea and ſo far forth doe they efteſoones procéede, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there remayneth vnto them, what they may giue an imparte vnto others, and at the length may, either publikely or priuately teach the doctrine of pietie vnto the reſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe that hiſtory likewiſe of <hi>Mathew 2.</hi> as touching the wiſe men that come from the Eaſt to worſhip Chriſt, it ſhall be very eaſye to applye wholy to the tractation of one common place. The ſtate or common place maye apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee prefixed, as concerninge vocation or callynge.</p>
               <p>This ſtate beinge aſſigned, firſt of all ſhall bee declared, whenſoeuer God calleth any man by a ſigne either exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or internall, or rather by them both, to the knowledge and confeſſion of the Goſpell, or els to ſome certaine kinde of lyfe, in which he may dayly ſerue God and profyte his neighbour, that he ought not to refuſe, but with chéerefull harte to come and deuoutly obaye vnto the caller.</p>
               <p>In the ſeconde place where it is reported that <hi>Herode</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole citie was troubled, thou ſhalt not without cauſe inculke an exhortation to ouercome temptations.</p>
               <p>For thus commonly it commeth to paſſe, aſſoone as any is elected and called of God to a godly worke Sathan by and by together with his conſpirators the fleſhe and the worlde worketh wiles, and leaueth nothinge vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whereby they may withdrawe him from his good and holy purpoſe. But their followeth in the thirde place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which in this kinde of conflict bringeth an excéeding great comforte, namely that againſt the moſt fierce and bitter temptations a preſent remedie is to be ſought for out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scripture.
<pb facs="tcp:22885:133"/>The lawe, the prophetes, and Apoſtles doo certifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as touchinge thinges doubtefull, they ſhewe moſt apparauntly where Chriſt is to be founde, and where the minde finally may reſt in ſafetye.</p>
               <p>For it is euen the holy Scripture alone, that confirmeth and ſuſteyneth thée in the knowledge and confeſſion of the Goſpell, in ſincere faith, in puritie of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Fourthly, where the ſubtelty of <hi>Herode</hi> priuily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the wiſe men vnto him is diſcloſed, ſhall very well be added that after the firſt and moſt grieuous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ouercome, and after the minde is confirmed, and that by the ayde of Gods worde, in hir calling &amp; holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there remayne as yet ſucceſſiuely newe daungers which hipocrits, which falſe teachers or heretickes, which tyrauntes, and ſuch kinde of aduerſaries of true religion will forge and contriue.</p>
               <p>For as longe as we liue here in this life, ther is nothing but perils vppon perils, and euen as if a certaine rancke of troubles were linked togither with chains, ſo doth one diſtreſſe after an other faſten vppon the godly.</p>
               <p>But yet we ought in no cace to be diſcouraged in our minds through the frequency or greatneſſe of the perills.</p>
               <p>Hitherto perteineth that which followeth in the fift place, as touching the departure of the wiſe men, and the ſtarre againe going before them.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt here not vnexpertly add, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which by vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt ſtriuinge bath already eſcaped the daungers of the firſt and ſeconde ſorte, doth nowe lye (as it were) at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and reſt in a quiet baye. For let the Champion of Chriſt conſtantly enſue the firſt ſignes of his callinge, but moſt diligently let him folowe the ſcripture, which doth aſſure him of his vocation and all the order of his dutie, &amp; he ſhall (vndoubtedly) come vnto that place, where hee ſhall ſee Chriſt in his glory, and obteyne thorough him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life.<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>He that endureth to the ende ſhalbe ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſte therefore all the partes hereof not vnaptly to be reduced to one common place, as touching calling or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:22885:133"/>vocation, and perſeueraunce in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Againe in lyke maner the hiſtorye out of <hi>Luke. 2.</hi> as concerning the confeſſion, which as well <hi>Simeon,</hi> as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> made of Chriſt, ſhall fruitfully be expounded, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of it, how neceſſarye it is, that all the faithfull, whenſoeuer oportunitie will ſerue, ſhoulde render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or that which is all one, make confeſſion of theyr faith.</p>
               <p>And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> this is the ſtate of the ſayd reading, it ſhal truly vs auouched, as ſoone as mencion ſhal be made of <hi>Simeon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly at the wordes of <hi>Siemon,</hi> in which he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Chriſt to be put for the ruine and vpryſinge agayne of many, and for a ſigne which is ſpoken agaynſt, &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that a ſworde ſhoul perce <hi>Maries</hi> ſoule, ſhal aptely be intreated as touchinge that poynte, that a confeſſion made is alwayes purſued with offences, ſondry mocions, contencions and great daungers.</p>
               <p>The world neuer ceaſeth to bringe the godly confeſſors into peryll and hazard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where it is deſcribed what maner of perſon the ſayde <hi>Anna</hi> was, how godly and vnblameably ſhe lyued, very oportunely next after thoſe wordes briefelye decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhall be added, that whereſoeuer the confeſſion of faith taketh place, ther ought alſo manifeſt fruits of faith, and manifold exerciſes of pietie to be ſeene. Finally that confeſſion is known to be perfect, which on the one ſyde is accompanied with the perils of temptations &amp; perfecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and on the other ſide with the notable fruites of faith.</p>
               <p>With ſuche a confeſſion God is delighted, the reſt of the godly are ſtrengthened, the enemies are directed and diſcouraged, the Diuell hymſelfe is diſcomfited and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dude.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Anna</hi> is reported to haue confeſſed lyke wiſe, and agreeing in al poynts with <hi>Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to haue ſpoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſo of Chriſt to al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> looked for redemption. Not without cauſe therfore ſhall be declared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt place, how it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a confeſſion in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes &amp; members therof be
<pb facs="tcp:22885:134"/>agreeable with the worde of god, &amp; further, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it remayne apparaunt, franck, firme and conſtant, euen to the ende of lyfe. And thus the whole ſermon very neere ſhall be ſpent about one common plate touching the making of a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith. But I feare leaſt ther be ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil cry out and accuſe me to be ouer tedious: wherfore I forbeare to adde any more examples.</p>
               <p>Further there is no cauſe why any man ſhoulde ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> héere are digeſted allegorical interpretations. For the ſtate is alwaies drawen forth out of certaine words apparauntly placed in the narration.

Beſydes, there is no other thing ſought for héere, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the interpretation of the parts, may both be directed to one fountaine or common place, &amp; alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon inſtruction of life in rightuouſnes. For if ſomtimes out of doctrines, yet for the moſt parte we ſée al this order of interpreting to be gathered out of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which otherwiſe, according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue exhibited in the thirde chapter, may be excerpted out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers.

               </p>
               <p>For he in his <hi>homilie 67.</hi> vpon <hi>Mathew</hi> ſéeking occaſion to prouoke his hearers to deſerue well of the poore, ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth two partes out of the text of the euangelical hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, which he interpreteth of one &amp; the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place, procéeding in the like order that wee haue done, and ſo longe taryeth he in them, as he iudgeth to be moſt fyt &amp; conuenient.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:22885:134"/>
               <p>The one part is of Chriſt the king méeke &amp; poore, whiche was contented to be caried vpon a ſhe Aſſe: wherin <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> teacheth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things are only of vs to be ſought for, which the neceſſary vſe of lyfe doth require, and that pouerty is to be taken in good part of al men.</p>
               <p>The other, wherein it is ſayd, that ſome layde their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon the Aſſe, &amp; ſome ſpread them in the way: this <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> explaneth as touching helping and clothinge of the poore. Therefore to the commending and ſetting forth of the poore tendeth the explications of the cauſe of the two partes, and ſtandinge ſomwhat long vpon either of them with great ſharpenes of ſpeache, ſetting abroche all the engings of arguments, he exhorteth, vrgeth, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth, impelleth all men to indeuour to be benefyciall to the poore.</p>
               <p>Nowe that héere are to be ſéene allegorycall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, no man being in his right minde, will affirme, but all men may eaſely perceiue them to bee playne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Howbeit in the ſame ſermon <hi>Criſoſtom</hi> there rather vſeth an allegory where he auoucheth: that by the Aſſe is ſygnifyed the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> people accuſtomed to beare the burthen of the lawe: and by the Colte the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which liued alwayes without the law, without burthen, without the diſcipline of Gods commaundements.</p>
               <p>That the Aſſe like wiſe and hir Colts were brought of the diſciples, foraſmuch as the Apoſtles by the preaching of the word ought to conduct both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peoples vnto Chriſt. That Chriſt moreouer rode vppon either beaſt as theyr Lord, for that he gathered to himſelfe of either people an obedient Church, and that the Goſpell is paciently heard of their both.</p>
               <p>That no man forbad the beaſts to be brought vnto chriſt, bicauſe it lyeth not in the power of any man to ſtop the courſe of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>In the Colt ſo ſodenly admitting one to take his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> without kicking to be ſhewed the prompt &amp; ready minde of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in receiuing of the Goſpell.
<pb facs="tcp:22885:135"/>Agayne, whileſt the Aſſe commeth after the Colte to be ſignifyed, that after Chriſt hath drawen vnto hym all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> alſo will one day with greate zeale follow after.</p>
               <p>By the diſciples putting their clothes vpon the beaſts, that Chriſt might the more conueniently ſyt, to he mente the teachers of the Goſpell, which ought not vnwillingly to beſtow all that euer they haue, yea euen their bodye and ſoule, ſo that their hearers may be furthered, and the glory of Chriſt more and more ſet forth. And thus muche welnigh hath <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> in that place.</p>
               <p>But yet there is no man that ſéth not the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be very diſcrepant, where one ſayeth, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as Chriſte was contented to be caryed on an Aſſe and hir Colte, we are taught, that wee ought to liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a fewe thinges, and pacientlye to beare our neceſſetie and agayne for that Chriſte was caried vppon an Aſſe and hir Colte, to bee ſignified twoe peoples, to wit, the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſhoulde acknowledge Chriſt to be their Lord, and receyue his goſpell.</p>
               <p>Agayne there is founde no ſmal difference, in caſe where the diſciples are reported to haue layed their garmentes vpon the beaſtes, whereon Chriſt ought to ſitte, it be one while added, that all men are there admoniſhed willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue clothes and other neceſſarys to the poore, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while it be ſayde to ſignifye, howe it behoueth the Preachers of the Goſpell to beſtowe all that they haue, yea euen their body and ſoule for their flock.</p>
               <p>Certes thoſe former interpretations are excerpted out of the natiue ſenſe of the words ſtanding in the text, and be perſpicuouſly referred to the inſtitution of lyfe, whiche thing is the cauſe, why <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> diſcuſſeth them with a more plentifull diſcourſe: but in the later interpretaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons digreſſion is made from the proper ſignifycation of the wordes, wherefore that they are allegorycall, and for &amp; that cauſe the leſſe profitable to the information of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22885:135"/>lyfe and mouing of affections, there is no man that canne well diſſemble: wherevpon alſo it pleaſed <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to touch them only in few words, and as it were beſide the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges therfore being duly conſidered, it wyll be very eaſy, to giue a right iudgement as touchinge the interpretations which wee haue vſed in this preſent Chapter.</p>
               <p>Firſt is briefely &amp; playnly expounded, in paſſing through all the partes, whatſoeuer belongeth to the ſacred narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Then to euery parte is ioyned an interpretation, in which appéereth nothing hard, wreſted, or farre fet: but out of the aduiſed conſideration of the words and ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are thoſe thinges deduced, which ingender holeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions or inſtructions of lyfe.</p>
               <p>And to make the matter more cléere and lightſom, euery thing is in ſuch ſort diſpoſed, that all thinges are directed to the nature and true vſe of one common place. In which reſpect no doubt the hearers capacitie is better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, then if many thinges and the ſame diuers and not euident ſhould be obtruded.</p>
               <p>Who therefore will deny this maner of interpretinge with great fruit to be exerciſed, and to be both godly and profytably produced to the people in the Church?</p>
               <p>And, as I admoniſhed in the beginninge, to thoſe that in the partes of the hiſtorycall narration can not by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a certayne courſe and order of cauſes, effectes, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents,</hi> and ſuche lyke places, it is no harde matter to make and adorne theſe kindes of interpretations.</p>
               <p>But from allegories, ſuch ineſpecially as very neceſſitie it ſelfe doth not extort in thoſe places of Scripture which of themſelues ſygnifye otherwiſe ſome inconuenience, euery man ſhall by mine aduice (ſo far forth as may be) abſteine.</p>
               <p>We ſée in ſo great a worke of the propheticall and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolycall bookes how fewe are vſed. It is playne that
<pb facs="tcp:22885:136"/>they are more apt to delight with then to teach, and that none but very ſlender proofes are deriued out of them, &amp; therfore that place is to be giuen vnto them onelye after other arguments, whiche haue in them more pithe and ſtrength.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:22885:140"/>as faith and workes are after a ſorte repugaunte the one to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other.

               </p>

                  <note place="margin">IIII.</note> Of this circumſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of time, he gathereth in the fourth place well néere after this maner: <hi>If Abraham had bene iuſtified by workes, then chiefely by circumciſion.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22885:140"/>But by this he was not iuſtified,</hi> foraſmuch <hi>as rightuouſnes was imputed vnto him longe time before he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Therfore in no wiſe commeth rightuouſnes by workes.</hi> The wordes of the Apoſtle as they ſtande in the text are playne. Furthermore Thapoſtle interlaceth foorth with the fifte argument,<note place="margin">V.</note> taken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe and ſignification of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. Abraham receyued the ſigne of circumciſion as a ſeale of the rightuouſnes of the ſaith which he had, when he was vnſircumciſed.</hi> Which we maye take euen as if he had ſayde: <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is not therefore receyued, to the intent any man ſhoulde be iuſtified thereby, but that it might be a ſeale of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſuraunce of rightuouſnes nowe before receyued by fayth. For a man muſt alwayes firſt beleeue and confeſſe his faith, or euer he can rightly vſe any ſacrament inſtituted of god: and vnleſſe a man alredye indued with faith doe receyue the ſacramentes, there is no cauſe whye he ſhould hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they will become holeſome vnto him.</p>
               <p>There is no man that knoweth not the ſacramentes to be ſigns of the couenaunt made before with God, and that they are added as ſeales of our reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God, like as after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bargainers are agreed betwixt them ſelues wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and ſeales are accuſtomed to be made.</p>
               <p>The ſixt argument followeth of that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we ſhewed to be digeſted in the fourth place.<note place="margin">VI.</note> Seeing nowe it appereth that faith was imputed vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> for rightuouſnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was circumciſed, &amp; whileſt he was yet vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed it is a plaine cace, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo which are not as yet circumciſed, neyther dare chalendge to themſelues any good worke, may be iuſtified by fayth: and generally that vnto all men, whether they be circumciſed or vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, rightuouſnes ſhalbe imputed, ſo that by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham</hi> (which is indifferently the common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and prince of all beléeuers as well of the circumciſed, as hauing vncircumciſion) they repoſe their faith and confidence in God.
<pb facs="tcp:22885:141"/>
                  <hi>Hee receiued,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſcale of the rightuouſnes of the fayth which he had, when he was vncircumciſed, that hee ſhoulde bee the father of all them that beleeue, not beinge circumciſed, that rightuouſnes might bee imputed to them alſo. And the father of circumciſion, not vnto them onely which are of the circumciſion, but vnto them alſo that walk in the ſteppes of the fayth of our father Abraham (which he had) when hee was vncircumciſed.</hi> Moreouer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeauenth argumente he declareth that rightuouſnes before god hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth by faith, foraſmuch as it can not be that rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes ſhoulde be receyued by the Lawe. Of which thing he rendreth alſo in the cauſes. <hi>For where the lawe is, there imediately followeth tranſgreſsion: for ſuch is our imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and weakenes that wee can neuer exactely fulfyll the lawe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>And where tranſgreſsion is, what, I beſeech you, is to bee loked for but the wrath of god?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the lawe therfore or by workes wee can by no meanes atteyne vnto rightuouſnes.</p>
               <p>But to the intent he might the more eaſyly perſwade the ſame thinge,<note place="margin">VIII.</note> he inſerteth two inconueniences, which, if rightuouſnes were not to be loked for but by the lawe, ſhould of neceſſytie follow. <hi>If rightuouſnes or the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of ſpirituall benefytes ſhoulde then onely be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when the law were of vs throughly fulfilled, our faith no doubt ſhould be void, &amp; the promiſe of god of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a very abſurde matter in cace any ſhould auouch it thus to be, euery man perceyueth. For GOD vndoubtedly performeth that which he promiſeth: as he that neuer ceaſſeth to be true and iuſt of his worde.</p>
               <p>And where as is the certaine, fyrme, &amp; infallible promiſe of God, ther our faith ought in no wiſe to wauer or doubt. Let theſe thinges therfore he taken in ſteade of the eight argument.</p>
               <p>But nowe againe the Apoſtle ſtayeth ſomewhat at this,<note place="margin">IX.</note> that the holy ſcripture teſtyfieth that the promiſes belong not onely vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> but alſo vnto an his ſéede.</p>
               <p>In which conſideration beinge occupyed he remembreth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:22885:141"/>that in the olde Teſtament the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo are contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſéede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For it was ſaide vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham Gen. 17. I haue appointed thee to be the father of many nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherfore herevpon alſo he produceth an other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is framed in this ſort: <hi>The promiſed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall benefyts ſhal redound alſo to the ſeede of Abraham. But the Gentiles are knowen to be the ſeede of Abraham. Ergo, the promiſed benefits ſhal come in like maner to the Gentiles, though deſtitute of the lawe and voide of good works.</hi> Be this therfore the ninth argument taken of the proper ſignification of the worde <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Nations,</hi> and it belongeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places of inuention of whiche mention was made in the fift obſeruation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>X</hi> The tenth argument is added to deriued of the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things themſelues, which kind of proofes we ſhewed to be méete and requyſyte in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth obſeruation. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>aboue hope, beleeued vnder hope, that hee ſhoulde be the father of many nations:</hi>

                  <hi>according to that which was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him: So ſhal thy ſeede be. And he not weake in the faith, conſidered not his owne body, &amp;c.</hi> The apoſtle in déede deſcribeth the nature &amp; force of the faith, which is imputed for rightuouſnes, and ſheweth that it was very excellent in <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and far greater then any man could beléeue.</p>
               <p>He ſaith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true and perfect faith, doth aſſuredly &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly lay hold vpon thoſe things, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> excéede mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> by no menes are iudged to be hoped for, &amp; beſids, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it neglecteth, diſpiſeth, &amp; vtterly remoueth al things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are thought to be a let or hindraunce vnto it.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:22885:143"/>Neuertheleſſe we will aſſay, to exhibit a certayne order of examining thoſe theames, profytable and eaſye to be knowne to all men.</p>
               <p>It muſt bee called to remembraunce, that there were two formes or orders of places of inuention once attry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted of vs vnto this kinde, in the former wherof we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herced the diuine places, of vs afterwarde termed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <hi>generall,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>doctrine, redargution, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, correction,</hi> and <hi>conſolation:</hi> in the latter we diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed partly the places which commonlye after the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued maner they call <hi>logicall,</hi> and reduce them to certayne queſtions, partelye other alſo taken out of Diuinitie it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now therfore let vs ſée, howe by the direction and ayde of thoſe places, a ſingle theme may and ought to be expounded with the fruite of the hearers.

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I</hi> It ſéemeth good by all meanes, that he that wyll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a ſimple theme, doe preſcribe to himſelfe (following the example of the <hi>Logicians</hi>) a certayne order of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and exactly ſerch: Firſt, <hi>What it is of which the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Sermon is appointed:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>what partes, or how many formes be thereof:</hi> thirdelye, <hi>what the cauſes bee:</hi> fourthly, <hi>what the duties or effectes:</hi> fyftely <hi>what thinges be of aliaunce therevnto:</hi> ſixtly and laſtely, <hi>what contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it hath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither ſhall any man thinke this order to be diſpiſed ſéeing it is very much profytable, as well for the teacher as alſo for the learners, to haue a certayne method retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kept.</p>
               <p>But me thinketh I here ſome man obiecting vnto me: that this forme of entreating which I ſpeake off, is more frequented of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and of his followers the <hi>Logicians,</hi> then of the <hi>Diuines.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22885:144"/>And that very ſeldom or neuer among the prophets or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye fathers are to be founde any ſermons ſimply declared in this method.</p>
               <p>Verily I wyll ſay that which is trueth. To the enſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and drawing forth of the nature of euery thing out of darkneſſe, as many (certes) as are wiſely occupyed in the office of preaching, ſo oft as they wyll entreat of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple theames, doe ſet before them, as a rule, this order of queſtions. But yet this difference is to be marked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a <hi>Logician</hi> or philoſopher, and a diuine preacher. The <hi>Logician</hi> truely by his owne proper right, as he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vndertaketh and promiſeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will vtter &amp; bring forth whatſoeuer may probably be ſayde of euery argument y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is offered, &amp; imagineth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he hath diſciples deſyrous to bee come philoſophers, very curiouſlye and ſubtelty purſueth the courſe of all the ſaide queſtions.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Diuine,</hi> and ſpecially the Preacher, whiche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelfe to be the teacher of the whole multitude, and in it of a greate number of vnlearned, ſuffereth not his oration to be encloſed in ſo narrow ſtraightes, but as one raunging in a champion fielde, choſeth thoſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onely to be explaned, whiche he ſuppoſeth to be moſte congruent to the vnderſtanding of his hearers, and alſo moſt fyt for the place and time.</p>
               <p>Wherfore albeit be premeditating at home in his ſtudye what thinges are expedyent to bee propounded in the Church, haue thoſe queſtions before his eyes as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators of his thoughtes, yet after that hee hath ſome while debated the matter, he ſticketh faſte in the inueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation onelye of one or two or els of thrée queſtions at the moſt.</p>
               <p>Herevpon therfore grew the cuſtome, whereby for the moſt part the paſtors of churches do in the firſt place lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly diſcouer, what the thing is of whiche they purpoſe to entreate.</p>
               <p>Where if they be perſwaded that the thing is knowen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:22885:144"/>to the hearers, then with good cauſe pretermit they that queſtion. From thence they procéede to an other queſtion, whiche they déeme to be moſt conueniente for the place time and perſones, and doe alledge ſomewhat peraduenture of the thirde queſtion, whiche is as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſes.</p>
               <p>This being accompliſhed, they paſſe to that whiche is the fourth in number, namely, concerninge the duties or effectes.</p>
               <p>And in this wiſe with the explication of two or haply of thrée queſtions they make account to ſatiſfy their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Somtimes, and that not ſeldome, there happen thinges, which in no cace doe admit all the ſaid queſtions in Diuinitie. As for example, there is offered a thing that can be deuided into no parts or formes: Why then ſhould there be a queſtion prefixed of diuers partes or formes? In lyke maner when there can be giuen no contraryes of a thing, doubtles it were very ridiculous, to aſſigne a queſtion to be diſcuſſed of contraryes.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, there may happen alſo ſuch a theame, as may eaſely be conueighed through all the orders of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, yet notwithſtandinge the godlye Preacher, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as he enioyeth (as I ſayde) frée lybertye, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in mature deliberation and in ſage aduice taking, among many choſeth not aboue two or thrée queſtions to be declared in the ſacred aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Logician</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher</hi> doe gladly trye what they are able to doe, and doe take pleaſure in vauntynge of their wit: but the Preacher for his parte, weigheth and conſidereth what is moſte expedient to be done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the place and time, for the godly enſtruction and information of good men.</p>
               <p>Where fynally if it bee greatelye for the behoofe of the Churche to haue many queſtions expounded, yet ſhall it be the parte of a wiſe teacher to reſerue ſome tyll an other time.</p>

               <p>For truely ech man perceyueth that the proofes gathered together in ſuch breuitie and ſtraightenes as is vſed of the <hi>Logicians,</hi> doe make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treatiſe to become bare &amp; ſlender, and to breath foorth onely the <hi>ecliptick</hi> kinde of ſpeakinge of the Scoles: but if there be added further ſome certaine lightes and ornamentes of thinges, together with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cleannes (at the leaſte waye) of ſpeach, then will the honour ſeemely for the Church, and congruent to the mindes and eares of the frequent auditory, appere.

               <p>For as many arguments as are handeled for the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any queſtion, it is very méete to be declared, and it is greatly for the behoofe of the godly to knowe, what fruite they may reape out of them.</p>
               <p>For certes (which maketh maruelouſly to the prayſe an dignitye of the holy Scriptures) there is nothing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current in them neyther doe we attempte to diſcuſſe any thing out of them, in which is not layed vp ſome notable doctrine very profitable to the confirmation of our faith, hope, charitye, to the ſtirring vp of our mindes, that we maye acknowledge the good will of God towarde vs, that we maye gyue him thankes for his incomparable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, that we maye be made prompt and chéerefull to render vnto euery man the duties of loue, alſo that we maye priuatelye leade an holy and blameleſſe lyfe, that we maye timely and moderately correct thoſe that erre either in Doctrine or maners, and finally that we maye obteyne comfort and redreſſe in publicke or priuate calamities.</p>
               <p>And this order of openinge the vſe of thoſe thinges, which ſhall be explaned in the kinde <hi>didaſcalick</hi> as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge any common place, we may finde euery where in the Sermons of the prophetes, Chriſt, and Thapoſtles, yea and in the Epiſtles themſelues:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:22885:146"/>Where truely vnleſſe the lawfull vſe be kept, and all things tranſfered to the proofe of pietie, and amendement of life, the knowledge doubtleſſe of moſt excellent thinges remaineth very barren and vnfruitefull.</p>
               <p>Of this kinde it is, that in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romains</hi> the beginninge of the fift Chapter, is diſcouered the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vſe of the doctrine touchinge the iuſtification of man by faith, whileſt many notable effectes are repeated, which accompany iuſtification by fayth, and doe wonderfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the dignitie of Faith: that alſo in the ſixt Chapter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had ſpoken of Baptiſme and the effectes thereof, hée annexeth a graue exhortation, that they ſhould recken themſelues dead vnto ſinne, but lyuinge vnto GOD, to the intent they might diligently foreſée that ſinne ſhould reigne no more in them, neither that they ſhould giue their members (as weapons of vnrightuouſnes) to ſinne &amp;c.</p>

For he is the ſeruaunt of the moſt mightye Lorde, namely God, which alſo created him: yea and in this lyfe ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth him, &amp; by his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne giuen for his raunſome, redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him, &amp; beſides all this hath power finally to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of him what he will. This Lord after his pleaſure and wiſdome preſcribeth a lawe, to which if man will obey, he ſhall receyue incomperable rewardes: if not, he ſhall ſuſteyne bitter paines both in this lyfe and alſo after this lyfe</p>
               <p>Which thing if we would ſomwhat more déepely conſider, all our pride ſhould forthwith of neceſſitie be quayled &amp; beaten downe. Why therefore doe we not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out delaye acknowledge onr eſtate, &amp; layinge a ſide all haughtines &amp; pride, ſubmitte our ſelues vnto our Lorde and maſter, being for nothing more carefull, then that we maye obey his commaundementes, and pleaſe him al our lyfe longe?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:22885:147"/>But yet is it not for all this, thoroughly knowen what ſin is. To the intent therfore we may more narrowly ſerch the nature of ſinne, it is requiſite that we looke vppon the lawe it ſelfe, by the tranſgreſſion whereof ſinne is committed.</p>
               <p>For ſo counſelleth the Apoſtle, where as <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> he ſayth: <hi>By the lawe commeth the knowledge of ſinne. Againe Rom 7. I knewe not ſinne but by the lawe. For I had not knowen concupiſcence, excepte the lawe had ſayd: Thou ſhalt not luſte.</hi> Let vs weigh therfore what the lawe requireth of vs, what it commaundeth, &amp; what it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſo ſhall the nature of ſinne more clerely appere vnto vs. Certes the lawe forbiddeth parcialitie in wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare,</hi> ſaith it, <hi>falſe witneſſe.</hi> It prohibiteth likewiſe vniuſt doinges. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> ſaith it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> &amp;c. Moreouer it commaundeth as well honeſt wordes as déedes, where it ioyneth the parentes to be honored, foraſmuch as it is playne, that the dutyes of honor, ought to be performed, not onely in wordes, but alſo in déedes. I procéede further, and finde that in the firſt precepte of the former table it is commaunded, that we ſhoulde worſhippe God with all our harte, with all our minde, and with all our ſtrength and againe that in the laſt precept of the ſecond table it is forbidden, that we ſhould not luſte. By theſe thinges nowe it is manifeſt, that by the lawe of God are condemned wicked wordes and déedes, all ſinfull luſtes &amp; affections, &amp; peruerſe cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and thoughtes hidden in the very entrayles of the harte. I will conclude therfore that ſinne is euery luſt, thought, will, ſtudy, worde and déede diſſenting from the lawe of God.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe as touching déedes vniuſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, there is no man but iudgeth of them,<note place="margin">Iacob. 1.3.</note> yea and thoſe thinges that are wickedly &amp; deſperately done, all men doe (at the leaſt) priuilye deteſt and abhorre as well in others as alſo in them ſelues. Furthermore all men doe agrée, that wée ought to be ſlowe to ſpeake, that our tongue is
<pb facs="tcp:22885:148"/>to be refreyned, and that he finally is perfect that fayleth not in his ſpeche.</p>
               <p>Beſides this,<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth that we ſhall giue account of euery idle worde that procéedeth out of our mouth. Howbeit that ſaying of thoughtes may ſéeme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture to ſome ouer hard and dure, and therfore that it néedeth a mitigation.</p>
               <p>But ſo it is verily: he that hath to doe with God, there is no place left vnto him either of feigning or diſſembling.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>For all thinges are bare, open and vncouered in the ſight of God. Man iudgeth onely of thoſe thinges that be apparaunte without, wherein he is both ofte times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, and alſo deceyueth: but God ſercheth the very harte and reines, and bringeth to light, whatſoeuer lye hidden within. Therefore <hi>Geneſ. 6.</hi> it is ſayd, <hi>that God ſawe all the thoughtes of mannes hart to be turned all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to that which is euill.</hi> And <hi>Geneſ. 22.

               </p>
               <p>But how ſhould any Chriſtians doubte, whither the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of hartes be open vnto God, when as the very Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes haue fréely confeſſed, that God hath reſerued that office onely to himſelfe? <hi>For the Gentiles as Paule repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Rom. 2. are a lawe to themſelues, and ſhewe the effect of the lawe writen in their hartes, their conſcience alſo bearinge witnes, and their thoughtes accuſing one an other, or excuſinge, in the daye when god ſhal iudge the ſecretes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And therfore truly doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſience prick, perce, ſting, and torment without ceaſing: foraſmuch as it knoweth that God not onely ſercheth and findeth out all ſecrete ſinnes and offences, but alſo moſt ſeuerely puniſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>We are lilke vnto Pilgrimes or to thoſe that trauaile in a ſtraunge and vnknowne country by waies, in which we are euery moment in daunger of théeues, wilde and venemous beaſts, waters, downe falles &amp; ſuch lyke hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and perillous things.

               <p>But examples wherein <hi>theames compounde</hi> of the kinde <hi>didaſcalick</hi> are moſt learnedly explaned, theſe ineſpecially be commended in the ſacred Scriptures. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romaynes</hi> the Apoſtle declareth at large, that men are iuſtified by faith without the workes of the lawe. Againe <hi>cap. 9.10.11.</hi> That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Iewes</hi> are reiected of god, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> called, to be the people or Church of God. In the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthes cap. 15.</hi> it is proued by ſtronge argumentes that the deade doe all riſe or reuiue againe. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathyans,</hi> it is againe confirmed, that men are iuſtified by fayth without the workes of the lawe, in the laſt part of the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo in the <hi>3.4.</hi> and ſome parte of the <hi>5.</hi> Chapters. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> Thapoſtle teacheth in thrée Chapters, that men by the onely grace of God in Chriſt, are elected, called, iuſtified, and glorified.</p>
               <p>The author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> in two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters declareth with wonderfull perſpicuitye, that Chriſt is true God, and true man.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Epiſtle <hi>cap. 7.8.9.10.</hi> out of one ſentence of ſcripture are drawen fower diſtinct <hi>theames compounde,</hi> and euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is with certaine and aſſured reaſons eſtabliſhed and explaned: whereof the firſt is, that Chriſt is a preiſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec:</hi> the ſecond, that the prieſthode of Chriſt is farre more excellent then the prieſthod of <hi>Aron</hi> or <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> the thyrde, that by the prieſthod of Chriſt the <hi>Aaronicall</hi> prieſthod is aboliſhed: the fourth, that by the prieſthod of Chriſt the olde cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſacrifices, and euen the lawe it ſelfe doe take an ende.</p>
               <p>In déede I muſt nedes confeſſe, that the ſayde Epiſtles are not writen in the popular kinde of teaching, but it is vndoubtedly to be graunted, that in them maye be noted ſuch a trade and maner of collectinge argumentes and proufes, and likewiſe ſuch a diſpoſition of thinges, as is to be founde in no other bookes of ſcripture beſide.</p>

               <p>That we muſt doe well in the leaſt thinges. That a Chriſtian man ought with great endeuour to tender Gods glory. That it behoueth euery man to be carefull for his owne ſaluation. That their treſpaſſes are to be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that haue offended vs. That the remembraunce of ſinnes paſt doth much profit. How we ſhould communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſacred miſteries. That we ought with all kinde of duties to giue thankes vnto God. That loue doth direct and accompliſhe all thinges. That we ought to loue euen our enemies, that perſecute vs.</p>
               <p>But it behoueth not the younge beginners, for whom we haue writen theſe thinges, to be accombred and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the multitude of examples.</p>
               <p>Hitherto haue we procéeded touching the diuers formes of Sermons in one and the ſame kinde <hi>Didaſcalick,</hi> in the tractation whereof like as with ſinguler fidelitye, ſo alſo with great diligence and induſtrie haue we ſpecified thoſe thinges, which we ſuppoſed were moſt profitable for our purpoſe. We haue in déede bene the longer herein, partely that we might make all thinges plaine and eaſye, and partely leaſt we ſhoulde of neceſſitie be compelled (to our great griefe) to repeate againe the ſame thinges in the diſcourſes following.

               <p>For thou ſéeſte how the prophiſies and promiſes of the prophetes are of Chriſt &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> expounded of thoſe things that then came to paſſe in <hi>Iudea:</hi> thou ſéeſt <hi>Rom. 4.</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhorte ſentence touchinge the maner whereby <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was iuſtified, to be applied to the interpriſed diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: thou ſéeſt <hi>Rom. 10.1.

               <p>For like as the Prophets doe take and apply thoſe their ſayinges out of the law, Chriſt and the Apoſtles both out of the lawe and the Prophets: So haue we frée lyberty to borrow all maner of ſentences whatſoeuer, out of the law, prophets, and apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And not onely olde and auncient matters out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scriptures, but alſo late and new, not much paſt our memory or the memory of our fathers, yea and ſuch daily as ſtyll come to paſſe, adde alſo thinges taken out of other writers, as Poets, Hiſtoriographers, and ſuch like, may ſomtimes fittely and opportunly be adioyned to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of any thing belonging to the preſent ſtate of thinges.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt when he laboured to moue all men alyke to repentaunce, to the entent they might ſo with feare and trembling looke for the comming of the Lorde, and ſome were then preſent that ſhewed hym of the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> whoſe bloud <hi>Pilate</hi> had mingeled with their ſacrifices, he aunſwering them that told him ſuch newes, ſayth:</p>

And wiſedome is iuſtified of all hir children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe the interpretations of the parables, as they are of Chriſt hymſelfe made and put forth, be repleniſhed with this kinde of craft and workmanſhip of applyinge. And how the Apoſtle in his moſt graue Sermons and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, hath vſed the teſtimonies or ſayinges of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, to witte, of <hi>Aratus Act. 17.</hi> of <hi>Menander 1.

               <p>But out of this admonition touching the heaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of proofes or argumentes, to be ſkilfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently applyed to the buſineſſe of which intreaty is made or to the preſent ſtate of the Church, floweth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exhortation, as holeſome and neceſſary as any other.</p>
               <p>That is, that all men would wiſely weigh and conſider with themſelues, how farre forth it ſhall be expedient to vſe the holy ſermons, whiche other haue made and ſetle forth.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of this exhortation when thou ſhalt heare, whoſoeuer thou art, I knowe thou wilt pronounce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bée iuſt and lawfull.</p>
               <p>Wée ſe (which is greatly to bée marueled at) the miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Churches euery where to be ſo tied and faſtened wholly to the bookes that conteyne the diuine ſermons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But it can not be diſſembled, that the authors of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons doe ofte times adnixe long and tedious digreſſions, alſo interlace without order reaſons and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſcrepant from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures openly recited: namely
<pb facs="tcp:22885:160"/>foraſmuch as they iudged them in eſpecially to be méete and conuenient for the place and time.</p>
               <p>Now it can not be, that thoſe ſelfe ſame thinges, ſhoulde be apt and correſpondent to the preſent ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, wherein thou ſupplyeſt the office of teaching. Howbeit let vs admit that there be no digreſſions at all, and that the holy ſcriptures are ſimply and ſincerely expounded in them: but what maketh that to thy purpoſe, I praye thée, if the whole explanation as it lyeth, be directed moſt chifely to thoſe poyntes of Chriſtian doctrine, whiche in thoſe places and times were in déede very aptely and with great grace handeled of the Preachers, and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablye receiued of the hearers, where as nowe in theſe dayes and with thy audien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es they will all bee out of ſeaſon?</p>
               <p>To what ende ſerueth the explication of that portion of Scripture, wherein are confuted the mayntayners and defenders of two contray beginninges the <hi>Manichees</hi> or other hereticks: whoſe aſſertions haue now no where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place? What ſhall it profyt to inueigh againſt thoſe that gad to the <hi>Lyſtes</hi> or <hi>Theater</hi> to beholde playes and games, before that people whiche is vtterly ignoraunt what thoſe termes meane?</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is no poynt of wiſdome nor conuenient to vtter ſtraight wayes euery thinge openlye (eſpecially in <hi>diuine</hi> matters) that is gathered together by the labour and iudgement of other men.</p>
               <p>For they doe alledge in déede out of the Scriptures, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, examples, proofes and probations of all ſorts, but foraſmuch as ſome of them doe note the ſame very brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and onely, as ye would ſaye, by poyntes or titles, ſome alſo doe ſcrape them together at all aduentures, out of others, whiche haue lykewiſe lately publiſhed and put forth Sermons: it is very requiſite (except thou wilt caſt as well thy ſelfe as thy hearers into open daunger) that thou ſhouldeſt diligently examine euery thing, &amp; takynge a narrow new of the fountaines of ſcripture &amp; obſeruing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:22885:160"/>there all thinges that either goe before or followe after, what cauſes or circumſtaunces hange together, agayne what driftes of reaſons or arguments there be, &amp; what force they be off, determine finally with thy ſelf, whether they be agréeable to thy purpoſe, or no.</p>
               <p>And by the ſame paynes taking that thou muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſuſtayne in this behalfe, thou thy ſelfe mighteſt as wel after thine owne lykement deuiſe a new and entier ſermon according to the ſtate of thinges preſent. But (to draw to an ende) be it ſo, that thoſe ſtraunge and forreine Sermons be in all reſpects perfect and ſounde, and that there is nothing, as touching either matters or wordes, wanting in them: yet art thou very much deceyued, which ſuppoſeſt that thou ſhalt with as good a grace ſette foorth the doyngs of an other man, as thou vttereſt thine owne made at home in thy houſe.</p>
               <p>Labour, ſtriue, enforce thy ſelfe ſo far as thy wittes wyll ſuffer, and yet truely will there neuer appere in thée that voyce, that plyauntnes of ſounde, that moderation of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and mouing, that grauitie, that ardent affection, that power and vehemency in words, which were found in the firſt author.</p>
               <p>Euery man is the beſt and moſt graue reciter of his owne doyngs. And the chiefe part of a Preacher, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with commendation is abſent, when he wanteth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation.</p>
               <p>I omitte to tell that if it ſhall fortune any of thy hearers to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſame author at home, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in a maner all thinges, it will come to paſſe that in ſhort ſpace thou ſhalt procure to thy ſelfe great haterd and contempt amongſt all men. I could my ſelfe (wil they ſay) make as good a Sermon as our Preacher. I can read at home at my houſe euery day in the wéeke al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he preacheth, neither is there any cauſe why I ſhould after this reſort to the church.</p>
               <p>And by this meanes is enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred in their minds a certein
<pb facs="tcp:22885:161"/>contempt of holy aſſembelies, and by litle and litle all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall actions and the whole miniſtery of the Church begin to waxe vile and lothſom.</p>
               <p>Verily I beléeue that thoſe which doe alwayes thus vſe, yea rather abuſe, the labours of other men, &amp; bring forth litle or nothing of their owne, are of <hi>Gregory Nazianze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> well and thriftely taunted and taken vp, where as in his <hi>Apologeticus</hi> he ſaith:</p>
               <q>If there be any peraduenture that haue learned two or thrée ſermons, out of the auncient writers, and that haply more by hearing then by reading: Or in caſe we haue kanned a few <hi>Pſalmes</hi> héere and there out of <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; afterward doe vſe them by apparelling them with a more fulſome and well plighted veſture, or if we can bragge and vaunt of Phyloſophy euen to the ſtarres, counterfettinge a certaine ſhewe of godlyneſſe, and diſguiſing our face with ſuch like inuentions, we will now in all the haſte be prayſed, and had in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we thinke now forthwith to be placed ouer ſome peoples, we ſéeme, in our owne fantaſy, euen from our cradels to be ſome conſecrated <hi>Samuels:</hi> We will alſo be counted wiſe and teachers of diuine miſteries, yea and ſet our ſelues amonge the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of law. &amp;c.</q>
               <p>And certes it is to to be lamented, that the labours of moſt excellent men repleniſhed with no leſſe learninge then godly zeale, ſhoulde be racked to a far other end and purpoſe, then the authors, when they put them forth, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they ſhould haue come.</p>
               <p>For we ſée how ſhamefully both the vnlearned and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do abuſe them alike.</p>
               <p>Thoſe verily, when by the helpe of them, they craftely and deceitfully intrude themſelues into the eccleſiaſtical function, for the which they are vnméete, and theſe for that aſſoone as they haue gotten them, they become all together ſluggiſhe and ſlouthfull, they neglect to peruſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:22885:161"/>the holy ſcripture and other godly bookes, they are not carefull, neither doe they once thinke any more to frame ſermons by their owne with and labour.</p>
               <p>And yet it is moſt certaine, that the ſcope and meaninge of thoſe good men was not, to aduaunce and promote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dignitie any impudente, vnlearned and ſhameleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or to maintaine the ſlouth &amp; vnluſtines of any meane ſchollers, and of all other they ment leaſt to withdrawe any from the readinge of the canonicall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But this rather they alwayes wiſhed, and hoped by all meanes it woulde come to paſſe, that the <hi>Lucubrations</hi> which they conſecrated to the whole Church, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the iudgement thereof, ſhould redounde alſo to the profit and vtilitie of all the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>And amongeſt other, their deſire was chiefely to profite thoſe, that being called to the eccleſiaſticall miniſtery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with commendation to exerciſe themſelues therin, to the intent doubtleſſe they might out of their moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred workes gette a ready and familiar methode of <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> teachinge, to the intent they might learne apte and vſuall phraſes, the maner of findinge and diſpoſinge all maner of proofes, of choſinge and applyinge common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to be ſhorte, the order of mouinge of affectious: againe to the intent they might by their example be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and prouoked to the continuall readinge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Apoſtolick books, to the collection of apt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and argumentes out of the ſame, and to the diligent deuiſinge and framinge of ſacred Sermons.</p>
               <p>For like as thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſell Sinamon, Galingale, nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migs, cloues and mace, and ſuch like ſtraunge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpices, doe vſe to giue a peéce of euery of them for a taſte to the commers by to the intent they might the raher be allured to bye. Euen ſo they that haue put forth bookes of holy ſermons, haue wiſhed, and deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge more, then by giuinge (as ye would ſay) a certaine taſte of diuine matters, to excite all men to the reading of holy bookes, and to encreaſe their, diligence in the ſtudy of
<pb facs="tcp:22885:162"/>imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now hitherto doe al theſe things tende: We co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit to perſwad al thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue already applied their mind to the miniſtery of the Church, yea and we beſéech them in Chriſt Ieſus: that firſt &amp; formeſt they would withall poſſible diligence peruſe and turne ouer the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conteined in the body of the holy Bible, that they would make them to be moſt familiar vnto them, whiles they may haue out of them ſondry and manifoulde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of heauenly doctrine prepared againſt all euentes &amp; purpoſes: then after that they would with as great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour as they can, enure themſelues to make and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe godly Sermons after the patterne and examples of the Sermons of Chriſt, the prophetes, and Apoſtles: and laſtely that they would aptly and conueniently apply to their buſines in hande, thoſe things that they ſhall finde in other doctors of the Church whither they be <hi>Greekes</hi> or <hi>Latines,</hi> to be profitable for their vſe, directinge in the meane time all thinges to the glory of God alone, and to the edifyinge of their hearers. And ſo finally by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhall they be iudged, and that truely by the verdicte of the authors themſelues, rightly to vſe and enioye the laboures and trauiles of other men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath left behinde him fower ſuch orations, one of the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> an other of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and two as touching the departure of his brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi> albeit <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelfe doth entitle theſe laſt rather by the name of bookes.</p>
               <p>And like as it appereth thoſe fathers to haue borowed this example of pronouncinge orations in funerall ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whoſe cuſtome (as we reade) was to prayſe men when they ſhould be buried, eſpeciallye ſuch as were noble and famous, in an oration before a great aſſembly of people: Euen ſo they followed alſo their trade and faſhion, when (as ye would ſaye) ſticking faſt to the rules of the <hi>Rethoritians</hi> as touchinge the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of perſons, they reherſed many thinges of his lyfe that was fallen a ſléepe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde, repeatinge all thinges

               <head>Of the kinde Correctiue. Cap. XIII.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the kinde of Sermons <hi>Redargutiue</hi> are properly confuted and amended all errors contayned in aſſertions or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of doctrine: Euen ſo in the kynde <hi>Epanorthotick</hi> or <hi>Correctiue</hi> is reproued &amp; corrected whatſoeuer is founde vicious and offenſiue either in maners or rites.</p>
               <p>Therfore to this kinde pertaine all Sermons and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ordeined to reclayme men to a better trade of life, or to ſuppreſſe vniuſt dealinges, or to condemne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are rifely vſed, whither they doo conſiſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, or diſſwaſions, either in dehortations, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukements.</p>
               <p>For all theſe formes muſt we vſe when we take in hand to correct the maners and conditions of men. For why we perſwade and exhort that men leauinge vice woulde embrace vertue, we diſſwade and dehort from thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are iuſtly to be reproued.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we blame the perſons that are ſubiect to any notorious vices, and we teache and commaunde theyr company and fellowſhip by al meanes to be auoided, we rebuke naughty and vncomely déedes, we reproue the thinges themſelues, namely all kindes of ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:22885:175"/>
               <p>Unto this kinde may inuectiue Orations, worthyly be thought to be allyed. For what doe they elſe contayne, then gréeuous corrections, or reprehenſions of vniuſt and iniurious dealinge? Of ſuch are a couple extant put forth of <hi>Gregory, Nazianzene,</hi> agaynſt <hi>Iulianus.</hi> Of the ſame ſort is there an Oration of <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> touching <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> the Martyr, As in which be contayned, alſo many things agaynſt the ſayd <hi>Iulianus,</hi> which Oration not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding beareth the title not of an Homilie, but of a Booke.</p>
               <p>Albeit ſome man peraduenture may iudge, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuch wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings tend not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> correction of any y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue offended (for how may he be corrected which is there chéefely aſſaulted and inueighed agaynſt, when it is playne &amp; euident y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ſame wicked perſon had now alredy by the myſerable &amp; ougly ende of his lyfe ſuſtayned the paynes of his impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?) but rather to the comforte of the Godly, which ought to reioyce and be glad, for that they are by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſafely deliuered from the tyranny of their no leſſe crafty then cruell enimy.</p>
               <p>Howbeit after what ſorte ſoeuer thou be diſpoſed to frame thy ſelfe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> correction of corrupted manners, whether I ſay by diſſwading, or dehorting, or reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or by any other meanes, the very ſame places truely maye ſerue thy turne in this behalfe, which are recyted orderly in euery the partes of the former kinde. Onely this muſt thou doe, namely tourne all the ſayd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the contrary parte.</p>
               <p>For where any thing is to be perſwaded (as we ſayde) by reaſon of the honeſty, of the iuſtice and equity, of the ſurety, of the eaſineſſe thereof, and ſo foorth: in this kynde of Sermons verilye thou ſhalte with no greate laboure diſſwade any thinge, if in caſe thou canſte proue it to bée diſhoneſt, vniuſte, iniuryous, perril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, diffyculte. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the ſame order ſhalte thou procéede in dehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and controlements.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22885:176"/>
               <p>For thoſe places which we haue digeſted in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afore going, being declared after a contrary ſort, ſhal euery where be vſed and applyed.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe whoſoeuer he be that heareth his purpoſe or fact to be reproued and condemned with ſuch lyke rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and perſwaſions as theſe, it can not be choſen but that he ſhall inwardlye be moued, and by litle and litle pierced (as it were) in conſcience, wholy ſubmit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Which when it commeth to paſſe, there is good hope of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd, that he will euery day more then other forſake his former euill lyfe, and returne into the right waye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.</p>
               <p>For in déede it ought to be the ſcope of all <hi>corrections,</hi> to bring men to the knowledge of their ſinnes, to the intent that ſéeing the greatneſſe and filthynes therof, they might be touched with the care of their ſaluation, and brought to amendement of life.</p>
               <p>Wherfore what pointes ſoeuer be helpfull and neceſſary to this ende, whither they be taught in the workes of the <hi>Rhetoritians,</hi> or ſet foorth in the holy bookes of <hi>Diuines,</hi> ſhall aptely and rightely be applyed vnto this kinde of Sermons.</p>
               <p>As touchinge other pointes that are to be obſerued and marked in this kinde, they may bee perceiued partly out of thoſe things that we haue ſaid in the preceding chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and partly out of the <hi>cantions</hi> following.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as a number of things be required, yea and no ſmall helps of wiſdome requiſyte in him, that wil rebuke ſinnes with any fruit at all, therfore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we héere drawe forth and let downe many <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be of the care and feruentneſſe,<note place="margin">Cantions.</note> that ought firſt of all to be accounted off in Preachers.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I</hi> Firſt verily the teacher of the church ſhal often times, and with all his power (as I may ſay) conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that a good porcion of his office conſiſteth in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:22885:176"/>of ſinnes and vices, and that he then finally truely executeth the function of a faithfull Sheaphearde, when with all diligence he prouideth and forſéeth, leaſt with the ſcabbe and ytching of ſome one ſwine the whole flock in the Lords fielde ſhould be corrupted and infected.</p>
               <p>For vndoubtedly that whiche in times paſt the Lorde ſayde vnto the Prophet <hi>Eſay Cap. 58.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crye out of thy throate as loude as thou canſt, ſpare not, lyft vp thy voyce lyke a trumpet, and ſhewe my people their iniquitie:</hi> that alſo ought all Preachers to iudge to bee ſpoken vnto them by the ſame Lorde euen vntill this day.</p>
               <p>And I beléeue verily Preachers might (as it were with ſpurres) prick forwarde themſelues to the execution of their office, in caſe they would oft times conſider &amp; haue before their eyes that graue and weighty proteſtation of <hi>Paule</hi> thapoſtle vnto <hi>Timothy,</hi> and would interpret it to be made priuately to euery one of them, yea &amp; imagine that the liuely voyce of ſo worthy an Apoſtle reſounded dayly and hourely in their eares.</p>
               <p>The words of the Apoſtle be theſe: <hi>I proteſt before God and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt whiche ſhall iudge the quicke and the dead at the time of his appeering and in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Preache the woorde, bee feruent in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, reproue, rebuke, exhort with all gentleneſſe and doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certaine that whoſoeuer ſhall déepely engraue and imprinte theſe words in his minde, will not lightly giue occaſion that any man may iuſtlye ſaye of him, that he eyther for feare of daunger, or for hope of any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dytie is ſlouthfull and negligent in reprouinge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempninge the wicked.</p>
               <p>But what maner of perſon it behoueth him to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhall with grace and authoritie accompliſhe this thinge, wee will eftſoones declare.</p>

               <p>Next vnto theſe are thoſe that be commended and well thought off for the wonderfull puritie of their lyfe, and be themſelues voyde of all crime.</p>
               <p>For with what face ſhall they accuſe others, that are touched with the ſhame and remorce of their owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences? Then thirdly ſuch as by their excellent learning and erudition, deſerue to haue their wordes credited in al thinges.</p>
               <p>In which two vertues, I meane learning and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of lyfe, <hi>Timothy</hi> excelled, although but a younge man.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all thoſe in whoſe wordes the powre of the ſpirit doe more openly ſhew foorth it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It followeth of the time wherin it is conuenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ſinnes and vices.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III</hi> And certes then ought ſinnes to be reproued and controlled, when either the place of ſcripture that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, or ſtate of the churche, or maners of the people doe require the ſame.</p>
               <p>For at what time certaine vices and enormities begin to infect the multitude, the eccleſiaſticall Teacher ſhall in repreſſing of them duly and ſeaſonably be altogether occupied.</p>

               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IIII.</hi> And it is not to be paſſed ouer that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſayde in his <hi>4. homilie</hi> vppon the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Paule</hi> to the <hi>Philippians: That then the Preacher ought to keepe ſilence, when hee holdinge his peace, and findinge fault with nothinge that is done, there is ſure and certaine hope, that the euills which are committed, may bee turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: but if the contrary commeth to paſſe, ſo that he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge ſilence enormities are not onely not rooted vp, but all thinges alſo become worſe and worſe, then it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that hee goe forwarde in reprouinge ſo much as hee may doe. For hee that ſharpely rebuketh ſinners albeit he doth nothing els, yet thus much bringeth he to paſſe, that he ſuffereth not the miſchiefe to growe any further.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no leſſe worthy to bée noted is that which <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> hath left write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his booke <hi>1. cap. 9. de ciuitate dei: If therefore any man forbeareth to reproue and finde fault with wicked doers, for that he awayteth a more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, or feareth leaſt by that meanes they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe, or that other weaklinges, which ought rather to bee enformed to a good and godly life, ſhould bee hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and oppreſſed, and turned from the faith, this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to riſe of any corrupte deſire that hee hath, but rather of the rule and aduice of charitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after a fewe wordes in the ſame chapter: <hi>They that are placed in the higher degrees of life, prouiding for the moſt part for their fame &amp; ſafety, whileſt they feare the wiles &amp; inuaſions of wicked men, doe refraine themſelues from reprouinge of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And although they ſtand not ſo greatly in doubt of them, that they yelde through any, their threateninges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties to perpetrate the like euils: yet neuertheleſſe the very ſame thinges which they commit not with them, they will not commonly finde fault with, when as perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture they might by reprouing correcte &amp; amend ſome
<pb facs="tcp:22885:178"/>leaſt if they coulde not, their owne ſafety and renoume ſhould come into harſarde and decaye. And this they doe not vppon that conſideration whereby they ſee their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and ſafety to be neceſſary for the profit of men to bee e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtructed, but father thorough that infirmity, wherby they are delighted with a fawninge and flattering tongue, &amp; with a faire and calme day, and whereby they feare the iudgement of the common ſorte, and vexation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleſhe, that is, by reaſon of certaine bandes of couetouſenes wherewith they are enwrapped, and not for their duties ſake of loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi> Wherefore by theſe thinges when and how far foorth it is lawful to intermit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of vices, euery man may eaſely iudge. Nowe what thinges remaine chiefely to be reproued.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>V.</hi> There is no kinde of ſinnes, in which the Preacher ought to wincke and be tongue tied, or that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted without reproofe.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not inought egerly to inueigh and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch vices as are very great and heynous, but euen thoſe alſo ſhal be brought to the iudgement of the Church and called into queſtion, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common people eſtéeme to be but trifles in reſpecte, neither doe account them ſo great, as in déede they are. Prouided that thoſe euills be ſpoken againſt with more diligence and vehemeny which are growne to be of greateſt force with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and by reaſon whereof greater inconuenyences are feared.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> In the meane time the godly Preacher muſt take heede, leaſt that beinge moued with the falſe reportes and ſurmiſes of ſome men, hee fall to carpinge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling of certaine vices.</p>
               <p>It is ouer often tried by experyence, and that truely with the great offence of the whole Church, but with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perill of the eſtimation and good name of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thmſelues, what maſſes of miſchiefe the ouer
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22885:178"/>haſtines of ſome in beleeuinge euery one that commeth, eſpecially women and light perſons, haue brought in.</p>
               <p>And <hi>AEneas Syluius</hi> reporteth in his booke <hi>de aulicorum miſerijs,</hi> that is, touchinge the miſeries of Courtiers, how a certaine ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Millaine</hi> in times paſt made a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous complaint to one <hi>Bernardinus</hi> a Preacher, of all thoſe that lent their money vppon vſury, and that, vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this ende that when other ſhoulde ceaſſe and leaue off ſo to doe, hee alone might reape huge gaines &amp; prayes by that trade.</p>
               <p>Therefore neither thoſe thinges that are noyſed of the ſimple and ignorant, nor thoſe that be reported of ſubtill and craftye men, ſhall the miniſter of the Goſpell raſhly admit forthwith to be declared out of the pulpit to the people. The ſureſt and ſaffeſt way is, (where at leaſt be had lawefull méeting and conſultations of the Elders of the Church) to rebuke thoſe crimes and enormities, as touching which it ſhall be determined before in the ſelfe ſame aſſembly, that they ſhould openly be reproued and ſpoken againſt. Now followe diuers thinges touching the maner of reproouing.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>VII.</hi> Whenſoeuer it ſéemeth good to rebuke viees before all thinges it is neceſſary to premiſe certaine doctrine and reaſons, where out men (though blunt and rude) maye learne, that thoſe things which are of thée reprooued, be very grieuous ſinnes, and ſuch as deſerue eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For very weake and ſlender is that reproofe or rebuke, which is not grounded vppon Gods word, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſtrength therefrom.</p>
               <p>And that is it that the apoſtle meaneth, when, after he had ſayd, <hi>improue, rebuke, exhort,</hi> he wiſely addeth, that it muſt be don, by <hi>applying of doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> And that all corrections ought not to be framed a like, but one more bitter and vehement, an other more milde and moderate, is a things well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen of it ſelfe, partly by the kinde of crimes committed,
<pb facs="tcp:22885:179"/>and partly by the ſtate and condition of thoſe men that are ſnarled and entangeled with the ſame crimes. To the intent I ſaye not, howe in the Sermons of the prophets and of Chriſt we may obſerue the lyke trade.</p>
               <p>looke what prudence and circumſpection is requiſite in driuing awaye the diſſeaſes of the body, the ſame true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is required in expellinge the maladies of the minde. And as touching this difference wiſely to be made <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> hath ſomwhat in the beginning of his Enarration of the Epiſtle of <hi>Saint Paule</hi> to the <hi>Galathians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it behoueth vs notwithſtanding to declare, where it ſhall be conuenient to giue place to the milder and where to the ſharper ſorte of rebukes. Firſt therefore of the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <hi>IX.</hi> There be certaine offences touching the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherof it ſhall be ſufficient after a friendely and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing maner to admoniſh the hearers.</p>
               <p>Of which ſort it is, if a man ſpeake againſt the affectation of newe and ſtraunge apparell, againſt the contempt of mennes fond traditions, &amp;c. Which for the moſt part bée peculiar but to fewe, and are in no wiſe to be accounted among the manifeſt and greater ſort of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>If a man therefore ſhould with tragicall clamours and bitter rebuckes crye out againſt theſe thinges, he ſhoulde bring to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phantaſticall people, but euen the wiſer ſorte alſo returning home, would in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke ſooner laugh him to ſcorne, then bethinke them of any amendement at all.</p>

               <p>For in déede it is an horrible ſinne for a man, in his talke to miniſh ſinne, or to make it ſéeme leſſe then it is.</p>

               <p>To be ſhort, it is plaine and euident that maieſtrates are to be reprooued in time and place as ofte as they depart from the path of rightuouſneſſe: but with what foreſight and prouiſion that is expedient to be done, no man canne certeinly demonſtrate by rules, but it is neceſſarye, that euery man according to his owne diſcretion, doe partely out of the ſermons of the prophets and of Chriſt, partely out of the kinde, cauſes, &amp; circumſtaunces of matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident gather and deuiſe with him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Neither truely doe I knowe very well how it commeth to paſſe, that in the Sermons of the Apoſtles wee finde not any thing ouer hardly ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt any maieſtrates, but rather there occurre many thinges whereby ſubiects are admoniſhed to obey them, yea though they be euyll and wicked.</p>

               <p>That he is the ambaſſadour and meſſenger of the highe GOD (for ſo doth the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> call the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Churches Angels): and therfore that he neither can, nor will vtter any other thing, then that which hys mighty prince hath giuen him in charge.</p>
               <p>Againe, that all thinges whiche he ſpeaketh are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the diuine Oracles, and defended by the force of the inuincible trueth.</p>
               <p>That he in no wiſe feareth the iudgements of godly and learned men, which ſhall vprightly &amp; indifferently weigh and conſider his cauſe.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Howbeit as concerninge comlines in geſture and pronunciation, briefely and truly to ſpeake what I thinke, looke how great care is to bée imployed in orderinge of the life, and dayly conuerſation, euen ſo great alſo ought worthily to bée taken to the due gouernment and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſpeach.</p>
               <p>For doubtleſſe the ſpéech is a certaine portion of the life, and that truely not the leaſt.</p>
               <p>And ofte times by the ſpéech, is a great gheſſe and iudgement giuen touchinge the whole inclynation and diſpoſition of a man.</p>
               <p>For it is playne and euident that puritie and ſimplicitie ioyned with prudence and diſcretion, like as in life, ſo alſo in ſpéech or communication is commended of all men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Preacher muſt at all times, but then chiefely when hee beginneth firſt to exerciſe himſelfe in Teachinge the multitude, take diligent héede, leaſt hée vſurpe any thinge in wordes, in pronunciation, or alſo in geſture, which may bréede and ingender contempt of his perſon with the people.</p>
               <p>Wee haue ſéene them ſometimes that haue ſo to often and in euery Sermon repeated ſome one worde or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, wee haue ſeene them that haue mingeled (euen to the lothſomnes of the hearers) tropes or figures, nothing fitte and correſpondent to the diuine matters which they had in hande, agayne wee haue seene them that
<pb facs="tcp:22885:194"/>in the hart of their matter haue vttered diuers times ſcarce honeſt and comely motions.</p>
               <p>And theſe thinges miniſtered occaſion to curious carpers and controllers of other mens doinges, to ſcoffers and ieſters amonge the rude ſorte, that when they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to procure ſport and laughter in their iunkettinges and tipling feaſtes, they thought there could be no ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing for theyr turne, then cunningly and pleaſaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repreſent the wordes, the voyce, the geſture of the Preacher.</p>
               <p>Yea and moreouer they accuſtomed through the ſames occaſions, to miſcall the Preacher himſelfe by ſome ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous name, as oft as in their talke they made any mention of him. What ſhould I ſay more.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of their vndiſereete and vnſeemely geſture, ſome are made the common talking ſtocke and publicke paſtime of the people.</p>
               <p>But to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anoyding of theſe inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which through vnſkilfull dealing in wordes and behauiour be incurred and falne into, two remedies ſéeme good vnto me for this preſent time to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The one is, that whoſoeuer taketh in hand the function of preachinge doe foorthwith ſet before him ſome one excellent Eccleſiaſticall Teacher, whoſe name is famous and renowmed, and who with ſinguler grace and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye expoundeth the ſacred Scriptures, in all reſpectes ſo far as may bée, to be imitated and folowed.</p>
               <p>For moſt commonly it commeth ſo to paſſe, that what all men doe iudge worthy of commendation in an other that alſo thou mayelt allure thy ſelfe (if at leaſt thou feately and cunningly reſembleſt him in that point) will be well liked and well thought off in thée.</p>
               <p>Hee that applyeth diligence to the imitation and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an other man, it can not be choſen, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he ſhall at
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:22885:194"/>length obteyne ſome of hys vertues, whom hée coueteth to bee like.</p>
               <p>And hée may alwayes finde ſome one, or more, (yea euen néere at hande alſo) right worthy to bée folowed &amp; imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which ſhall not bée an arrogant and partiall eſteemer of an other mans workemanſhippe.</p>
               <p>The other is, that the Preacher doe requeſt ſome good man beinge of a ſound and vncorrupt iudgement, that he would vouchſafe ſometime to admoniſhe him priuately, when he perceiueth any thinge in the ſpeaker, that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth either the eares or eyes of the hearers, and that in his iudgemente wolde bée amended.</p>
               <p>Wee our ſelues doubtleſſe are more blinde then Béetles in notinge of our owne proper faultes, to omitte (in the meane time) that a number alſo doe euen when they commit offence, foliſhely fawne and flatter themſelues: but ſome other truely doe eſpye many thinges, which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vs, and can wiſely diſcerne what pointes are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reprehenſion in vs.</p>
               <p>Certes many a one there bée that would in time reforme their owne faltes, if ſo bee they might haue ſuch a <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> as were voyde of all guyle and diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>Which thinge ſéeinge it is ſo, ſo far is it off, that the Preacher (if he bee a wiſe man) ſhould take the matter grieuouſly to be after a friendly and ciuill ſort comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of any man, that hée ought alſo to giue harty thankes to the comptroller, as vnto one (amonge ſewe) that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him eſpeciall good will and friendſhippe, couetinge by that meanes to prouide very commodiouſly for his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation and dignitie.</p>
               <p>That great Prophet <hi>Moyſes</hi> the loadſtarre and chieftain of all gouernours of the Church, ſufferd himſelfe pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bée admoniſhed of moſt weightie affaires by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe <hi>Hiethro,</hi> &amp; willingly imbraced &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed his wholſom cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle &amp; aduice: why ſhould not therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The foole deſpiſeth the chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his father,</hi> ſayth the wiſe <hi>Salomon: but he that endureth correction, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe.</hi> Againe, <hi>he that hateth correction, ſhall dye.

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Nowe it is requiſit that we ſpeake ſomwhat as touching the laſt point, that is to ſay, the ſtudy of nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and eſtabliſhing concord.</p>
               <p>Surely the concord and tranquilitie of Churches is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies interrupted and broken in ſonder by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers themſelues: of which ſeeing it would be ouer long and troubleſom to recken vp all, we will onely at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (forſomuch as the matter ſo requireth) rehearce ſome, omitting the reſt.</p>

               <p>Sée then how immediately and euen at the firſt daſh the vnlucky ſéedes of diſcord and diſſention are ſowen.</p>
               <p>Some there bée that bring into the Chruches ſtraunge and vnaccuſtomed phraſes or formes of ſpeach, and that to this ende that the ignoraunt and vnlerned might hée made to beleeue that they teach and ſet foorth maruelous and profound miſteries, which other men neuer learned or hard of before: when as notwithſtanding they vtter nothing worthy either of knowledge or admiration.</p>
               <p>Wherefore euen here againe, as well theyr colleagues as the people, beginne to whiſper and ſtomake ſomwhat againſt them.</p>
               <p>Now and then thou mayſt finde ſuch as not onely in wordes, but alſo in the thinge it ſelfe, doe vehemently differ and diſſagree from their fellowe brethren, whiles namely they goe about to graffe into the mindes of their hearers newe and ſtraunge opinions touching the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, or at leaſt imagine ſome other thinges as hurtfull and noyſome: of which ſorte is this, when they take vppon them without cauſe why to innocate certaine thinges in the Rites and Seremonies of the Church, when they pretend I knowe not what viſions and reuealations, when they promiſe to propheſy and foretell of thinges to come, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>For by theſe ſleightes &amp; wiles as it were with charmes and inchaun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:22885:196"/>friendly and plauſibly receiued.</p>
               <p>Againe the vnconſtant people through hearing of ſtrange deuiſes, are euen with the turninge of a hande deuided into contrary factions.</p>
               <p>Certaine Preachers there are which doe ſet wide open their eares (ſuch is their folly) to fonde detractors and backbiters, which delite to bringe tidinges, what this or that body hath at any time reported of them and their Sermons, or of their maners and conditions, and in the meane while they themſelues feigne and imagine many thinges that no man euer thought off or ſpeake off, yea &amp; no ſmall number of thinges well and friendly ment they wreſt and wringe to the worſt part.</p>
               <p>Here vpon therefore &amp; by this oceaſion are againe harde from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pulpet many things vttered with great deſpight, angry and diſdaynfull inuectiues, and if ther be any other thinges more bitter then theſe.</p>
               <p>Wée haue harde of ſome that haue fallen to ſuch outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious folly, that they would take aduice of moſt vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and buſy tatlinge Goſſups, and would ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bée ſtinted and limited by them of what matters they ſhould intreate, and howe and after what ſort they ſhould frame their Sermons in the Church.</p>
               <p>Wherefore héere againe is miniſtred manifolde matter of errors, and therefore alſo of contentions.</p>
               <p>To bée ſhort, by theſe and ſuch like meanes (for I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende not to touch any more) it is brought to paſſe, that if there bee many miniſters of Churches in one Citie, they heinouſly vary and contend one with an other, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doubtleſſe not onely of their next neighbours, but euen of ſtraungers alſo and ſuch as dwel a great way off from them: but if there bée not many miniſters of Churches together in one place, yet doe the reſt of the ſtates of the common weale and the whole people exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe moſt bitter iarres and priuy hatreds amonge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:22885:196"/>
               <p>Thus the ſmall foundations of diſcord and diſſenſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once layed, no man can lightlye expreſſe in wordes, how greatly the miſchiefe groweth, and how far in ſhort ſpace it ſpreadeth abrode.</p>
               <p>For ſodenly from one place or other do breake foorth new deuiſors of peritous treacheries, with whom it is but a ſport or paſtime to ſet ſimple and plaine dealinge men together by the eares, to miniſter féedinge to the flames of diſcorde, and (as it is ſaide in the prouerbe (to put fire to the match, or oyle in the furnace.</p>
